Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,54.2,Ardbeg UigeadailOB,"Not the first I've tried, mind you, but the first I've owned. Not sure why it took me so long. On the nose, there is warm, thick, sweet, perfumed, enveloping smokiness. A different quality of smoke that some of the other Islays I've tried. It is not sharp, or ashen, or medicinal. There is a tarry quality to it, and a salty note, but also a note of burning logs, interwoven with aromatic incense-like sweetness. As it sits in the glass there develops a molasses and caramel note. Very complex, yet not overly intense.  At full force, this comes strong on the palate. The tarry smoke really fills the mouth, driven in by the high alcohol and backed up by dark chocolate-covered cherries. The sherry casks are very well-integrated. I find with many smoky sherried whiskies the two styles can clash and become overbearing. Not here.  The finish is pleasantly smoky, not the usual mouth-full-of-ashes sensation from a Laphroaig or Lagavulin. Some fragrant sweetness as the flavour fades.  This is a really impressive Islay malt. I've had this bottle for over a year now and I feel I'm only coming to fully appreciate it now that it's almost gone. Great structure and intensity. It delivers from the aroma straight through to the finish. I hope to have more like this some day. At Domo, Eurobuilding Hotel, Madrid, on the house (thanks.)
It pours clean, amber to ochre hue. Aroma is very intense: tons of leather, coal, fireplace. No sweet scents whatsoever.
Mouthfeel is very -very warm, powerful and with almost no sourness at all (which renders it even warmer.) It develops good umami and saltiness, though. Very long finish with all the smokiness you could ever dream of packing together in a spirit. This scotch will put a smile on your face if you like your peat. Deep rich smokey tones linger and stain the palate. So much has already been written and spoken of this particular Ardbeg - affordable, despite the fact it is delicious and it is bloody strong.  One thing I should say. I do need to be in the mood for this beast. The slight medicinal quality makes it far from an everyday drink. But when I'm in the mood the solvent-ness never gets in the way of its beauty and its formidable qualities.  Also my memory of the Corryvreckan has always been more positive compared to this guy, so looking forward to trying it again soon! It's just before passover and I want to have an enjoyable dram before I lock up my collection to ensure it remains Kosher the rest of the year (in case I ever want to serve to someone who cares about such things).     I was going to review the last dram of this bottle, which I obtained in Calgary in December 2015 and opened January 3 of 2016.  It has been gassed after each use. I may have sent off some samples (my bottles don't usually go so quickly).  When I decanted this in October 2016 it turns out that I completely filled a 60 cc bottle, so I can't file this under ""finished"" just yet. The last bottle I reviewed was also down to the last 60 cc and didn't really live up to expectations.  Let's see if decanting helps: It is reviewed in my ""usual manner"". Nose Neat - Good start.  Ash, wine. Very rich.  Something fresh. The wine seems to fade with time leaving dry peat in the forefront.  Something that I recognize from my grandfather's old workshop, or, could it be, WD40?  A little burnt rubber, or plastic?  Or whatever those space lego tires from the 1980s were made of when you burned them to make it look like some sort of crash or something... A little longer and the sherry peeks through again. Nice. Layered, interesting. 22.5/25 With water - I get a hint of a green savoury spice, like oregano or tarragon. The ash is a little less in my face (literally).  The sherry and peat seem more integrated.  I get smoked ham on the nose now. A little more complex.  (23/25) Taste Neat - WHoaH! Oh, my! First sip was like licking an ashtray (which I have never actually done). I get sherry on a sweeter second sip, also grape juice.  The development is a little sour. Some sawdust.  Not too complex but quite unique.  21.5/25 With water - Lots of ash and peat on the first sip but it's integrated with the sherry. Slightly sweet. Development takes me through a number of flavours (all ashy). Touch of menthol a half an hour after the water is added. (22/25) Finish - I get cured ham every time I breath out.  Just from the first sip. Lasts a while. Very astringent.  22/25 Water sweetens the finish but it remains astringent.  (22/25) Balance: In general, this is not a balanced dram, it is very peat-heavy. But the nose and the palate are in synch.  21.5/25 Slightly more balanced with water. (22/25) Score - Neat: 87.5  With water: 89/100 Adjusted score based on experience:  90/100 I hate letting things go.  When I get to the near-end of my bottles I'm loath to finish them (especially if I don't have a spare or 2, which I do in this case).  I wonder if again, I let this go on too long.  I am pretty sure that in the first couple of months I would have scored this a 90 or 91, hence my adjusted score.  I think I need to learn to move on more quickly, another argument for not opening any more bottles till a few of these become history. Unlike the last review... I'll be savouring this one for a while longer... to the last drop. Happy Passover everyone! Ah, the Ardbeg with the almost unpronouncable name (‘oogedaal’), which means as much as ‘dark, mysterious place’. I tried versions from 2003 and 2009 and my whisky pal Pat just offered me a sample of 2015, which I gladly accept as it is one of my favorites from the Ardbeg core range (only the Corryvreckan does better in my book).
Grand nose on sweet elements from the sherry casks. Think banana and raisins, followed closely by furniture polish, herring on the barbecue and chunks of sea salt. Nuts! Mildly burnt chestnuts. The crust of old Gouda cheese. Sweet peat. Stockfish. Roast beef. Complex and better than I remembered.
Perfect mouthfeel, sweet and sour on smoked bacon with loads of ashes and citrusy elements. Liquorice, smoked fish, chili pepper, ginger, tar. Orange marmalade in the background. Grand. Strong. Sturdy.
The finish is very long, sweet and salty at the same time. A little bit schizophrenic towards the end, but what a feast.
If you ever taste a lesser Ardbeg (plenty of choices with the recent NAS-bottlings in recent years), pour yourself a dram of this Uigedail and your confidence will be restored. Around 60 EUR. Do it now! I was visibly excited when i found this at a small bar in Kaifeng. Unfortunately, the bottle is in Chinese and the bartender didn't know the batch #. But hey, $9USD for a pour. I might see if I can take the bottle home. Bottle is 3/4 full. Nose: Peat smoke as expected. Followed by some nice sweet fruit. Raisins, cherries, plums. Suprised at how sweet the fruit comes out. After a few sips i even get toffee and caramel. The sherry cask really shows in the nose.  Palate: The peat smoke really takes over the palate. Peat, charcoal, like a bbq in the mouth, along with some tingly spice brought on by the high abv I presume.  Finish: nice long finish. More peat smoke followed by a sour oaky flavor. At the very end i get a return of the caramel and toffee, but the fruit from the nose never returns. Overall: I had high expectations for this. And yes its good. I wish the palate was a little more diverse and balanced with more flavors, but the nose and finish are simply delightful. And the sheer force and strength of flavors in this can't be beat.  Im in this town for one more day, so if anyone wants this bottle before they're all gone, let me know.  I tried to find some older batches and came across this a year ago, so didn't hesitate to pick it up because the price is quite reasonable and the batch seem to be a good one. When I first opened it, I found this bottle has probably got some problem with sulfur, but didn't really trouble me besides can't drinking too much at a time, which will make me dizzy. After a few months the sulfur problem seemed to be unnoticeable.  This bottle has been opened for about 15 months. Nose: Fresh lemon peels, old sherry, fruit candy and honey. Very luring and I can feel there's heat inside.  Palate: Sweet and oily, quite soft for its high ABV. Dark chocolate, leather, peat, sea salt, burnt wood and basil. Bitter-sweet symphony.  Finish: Dry, salty, bitter and long. Barley, earth, ash and caramel. Long and warm, good smoky tone. Balance: What a crazy peat party dancing in my mouth. From sweetness to bitterness, from fruit and honey to salt and ashes, always changing but consistent.  Overall: What a great whisky. So easy to drink with so much flavor. It's sad to know the recent batches seem to be declining on quality, like Lagavulin 16, Old Pulteney 17, Talisker and other whiskies which used to be great. Although digging out good stuff is a lot of fun, but running out of good whiskies is not good news at all.  Thanks for the reviews in connosr which led me to this bottle, I will still check the reviews first if I wanna get a new one......  NOSE: explosion of peat, burned wood, damp earth after rain kind of aromas. Creamy Ardbeg 10 notes here as well. Brown sugar, a remote hint of vanilla. With time and some water you get more tannins, and mocha type flavors. Tiramisu, walnuts, hot chocolate. Water puts out the fire of peat a lot, thus revealing that lovely sherry influence: burned caramel, mocha coffee, prunes, figs, raisins with some spice. Some hints of butane gas, rubber, leather, delicious dessert-like pastry and dirty laundry. Some lovely hints of sour cherries to it as well. Very balanced, complex and intriguing nose. TASTE: it's firing on all cylinders: creamy, oily, sweet, sour, peppery, salty, slightly oaky with lovely chocolate sherry sweetness, peat, pickles and sherry. Slightly mineral towards the finish. FINISH: big warm herbal finish, slightly oaky, tobacco, seaweed, barbecue notes, smoked paprika. Bonfire. Chocolate caramel. Cacao powder, kelp powder, cinnamon.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: an absolute delight. Great balance, great combination of flavors, very complex. Just a stunningly good whisky. An instant favorite!  ‘Uigeadail’s meaning, according to the booklet that comes with the bottle, is the mysterious loch which provides the peat-laden water for Ardbeg. Literally, the word Uigeadail means ""dark and mysterious"". However, I must say that I don't find myself anywhere mysterious when sipping from this divine nectar; I find myself deep inside an old leather jacket of my father’s – comfortable, warm and dark scents of leather and worn corduroy lining, soaked with old cigarettes smoke. I'm not who I am today, I am who I was then. And he is who he’s used to be, when he had to kneel down to wrap me in his coat against the wind. This drink is mysterious, but it is not dark. It is everything that is balanced and right. Without a doubt, the most important single malt, in terms of my own personal journey in the world of whiskey, I have ever tasted. Sipped twice; before and after added 4 drops of mineral water. Nose – Strong, and full bodied. A veil of peat smoke, medicine and turpentine. Burned rubber, worn out leather. I would say, INDUSTRIAL. Nevertheless, behind these intense “unpleasant” odors, hides a gentle scent of fresh cereals and butter cookies. After adding water, the oiliness cleared off as you could actually walk through the fog and reveal flowered and colorful sweetness of breakfast cereals, oat porridge and honey. Palate – powerful, and complex. Medicinal, Smoke and fire, hints of dark chocolate, fennel, and caramel. Adding 4 drops of water brings out deep malty sweetness, butter flavored cookies, and some vanilla.  Finish – long. Oh, so long… It's been a while since my last review. And to be completely honest I wasn't feeling up to it. Don't know why. Just being plain lazy, I suppose. I would sit down with something and then decide to just drink it for the pure enjoyment of it. No notes, nothing.  So it needed something special to get me off my lazy ass and put pen to paper. And so I naturally went back to the whisky that gave me my first  moment. For me it was the Ardbeg Uigeadail.  I don't even know what year bottling it was. I just remember closing my eyes and savoring the moment. But in order for me to get back to writing it had to be a special Uigeadail. And so I rummaged in my closet for my Peat Pack which, along with the 10, 17 & 1981 Kildalton, had a 2005 bottling of said Oogy. I knew that the earlier Oogies were far more delicious than what we've been tasting of late. Just how good I had no idea. My sample is from the 5cl mini which is part of the Peat Pack collection with the bottle code . This makes it bottled towards the end of 2005 and at a strength of 54.2% Beautiful. Smoke. Iodine. Salt. Fresh oysters. Eucalyptus. Balanced peat. Vanilla. Dark chocolate. Hint of freshly shaved grass. Citrus. Orange marmalade. Touch of black pepper. So robust. Just perfect. Hard to find a nose more balanced or captivating as this. 24/25 Just the loveliest mouthfeel one can imagine. Oak. Cinnamon. That orange marmalade again. Black salt. Black peppercorns. Bitter chocolate. A little char. Soot. Singed kippers. Just a lovely juxtaposition of sweet and salty. 23/25 So long. Peat. Smoke. Slightly drying. Cinnamon. Oak. 23/25 This is what Ardbeg tasted like back when they had re-opened and were releasing new whiskies into the market. Even though it was NAS no one really cared to bring that up. Probably because they were, and still are, priced quite decently and just a lovely whisky to hold in your mouth. This is just the right dram to get you back into the groove of things. i tried this in Edinburgh last year, it's absolutely beautiful. sweet and hearty and even at this strength, i believe it doesn't require water. i tried a drop of H2o but it took away some of the flavour I drank my glass with a few drops of water. Actually, I use a dropper to get the attenuation just right. In my case, I prefer to add just enough drops to keep a bit of the sting on my tongue but not so much that my taste buds are stunned into less than their usual performance.  Despite being opened palmed by a member of a biker gang on the street of Middle Village Queens for no good reason at all other than being in the wrong place in the wrong time, my sense of taste and smell are above average.  That attack broke my nose and gave me two black eyes. I have a deviated septum these days thanks to the guy who attacked me in order to prove that he was still tough and useful to the other biker members after he got out of prison (at least that's what I heard later from a few friends that knew of him).  I guess beating up a bookish English literature student was a sign of prowess to members of the ""Georgian"" biker gang.  That attack happened in the mid-90's. So long ago. Life can be hard on a guy when he is only trying to head out to the pub for a drink on a summer's eve. At the time, I was living in the East Village of New York City, and visiting my friend R.  R's house was enclosed behind very tall chain link fences and cyclone wire. That should have been a tip off, I think. And then there was the time R and his sister and I were walking beneath an overpass and, against their advice, I peek in a black plastic garbage bag and saw what looked like a human femur. After I peeked in the garbage back under that overpass, I found myself really hoping it was a deer leg that some hunter had left there, and not what it had looked like.  That happened on Thanksgiving day. Prior to seeing the horrible sight, I'd eaten an excellent meal at R's house, and then drank some Guinness in a local Irish pub. Two stools down at the bar, there was a hole in the middle of the stool where some famous Irish gangster had been gunned down ten years earlier. People actually sat on that stool, hole and all.  Here are my tasting notes on the Uigeadail: Sight: Nice and dark for an Uigie. Bravo. Nice legs and beading in the glass, as well. Actually, I tend to call the part left behind the ""tide line."" In this case, the tide line is quite obvious and this is encouraging. Nose: Custard, pencil lead, sherry, marzipan, hints of charred palo santo wood, stale vanilla cake with vanilla icing (next day left out), wet cut grass sap. In time, this scent changes to black forest chocolate cake.  I must say this whisky is mercurial. It changes pleasantly with time in the glass. According to one of my friends, it also takes air quite well in the bottle over time and should not be rushed. I will savor it, for sure. Mouth: Attack moves from central tongue to upper mouth and back into the throat. Lovely. Perfect balance of peat and sweet. Bakers chocolate, beached and aging kelp, fresh stripped gorse, aniseed, wet sand, smoked monkfish, asphalt and tar, pool cue chalk. I am reminded just a bit of PC8. Extraordinary. Finish: Long and rewarding. Moves to the tip of the tongue. That Ardbeg peat is fairly young but near perfect (for a younger batch than pre-2009). Smoke and peat intermingle throughout the mouth. Less sweet and nearly all peat at the death. Love the toasted barley in this bottling. It is especially rich and full.  I've tasted quite a few Ardbegs in my day: everything from Alligator to Beist to Ardbog to Corryvreckan to Galileo to Supernova, to Auriverdes (sp?) to a ton of 10 Years. This is one of the better Ardbegs I've tasted. This said, I do prefer a well aired Alligator or Beist but then again those are very hard to come by. We always tend to crave what we can't have.  I love old Ardbegs. They are my favorites and the Beist has some older Ardbeg in them. I can remember back in the mid-2000's when I first fell in love with Ardbeg 10. I couldn't believe it was so reasonably priced and so good! Little did I know that it had some old stuff mixed in. If I had known, I would have put away a case or two of the precious broth.  As for this L11 028, it is very very good. I must thank Nock for the recommendation. He and Victor really shed some valuable light on All Things Ardbeg.  If you have the time, I recommend going back into their reviews of the Ardbegs and browsing through them. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge and two extremely experienced and sensitive noses/palates at work. Nock's knowledge of Uigeadail is particularly astounding. Today, I just bought a bottle of the ten year Ardbeg. I was quite happy to notice how the distillery is printing the actual dates on the bottles. What a bold step forward. I am so tired of trying to figure out the codes.  As a matter of fact, I was going to also pick up a Talisker 10, but I put it back on the shelf because I had no idea when it was bottled judging by the arcane code. I don't know if I've ever figured out how to decipher a Talisker code or not. It's been a while since last I tried. Word to the wise for all whisky bottlers: stop the games and just print the frickin date for cryin out loud.  At any rate, the 2015 Ardbeg 10 is the one I was curious. I read Serge's review and watched Ralfy's as well. Both seem promising. Serge seems to feel that 2015 is a very nice year for bottlings. But simply stating the year is really not enough to go on since there are quite a few runs in a year.  Still, it's the thought that counts. I noticed a few years back that the industrial nature of the broth was far more intense than in earlier years. I've been sipping the ten year in pubs recently over the past few months.  I think they have all been 2014 bottlings. Not bad at all. I liked it better than a few years earlier. But of course the mid-2000's ten year bottlings will always have a special place in my heart.  Nothing can compare to those fantastic bottlings. Most of us didn't know back then how good we had it. But then again, does one ever know such a thing? It's rare, except in 20/20 hindsight, by way of comparison with the not as great. In the case of this L11, I am very happy to say that 2011 was a very good year for Ardbeg, at least in run 28.  THIS is a dram worth paying for.  Nose: Smells like Christmas basically, fruit cake, pine, brackish water and the outdoors generally. It's not an ATG nose but it hints at what's coming. Mouth: Surrenders quite surprisingly after a really busy introduction. Spice and smoke have a wrestle up front as the whisky finds every sparkle in your mouth. Christmas again, spice before it settles into a delicious oily, smoky treat, but restrained by spice and gentle syrup. Special stuff. After: Goes down like water but what it leaves behind just never seems to end - extraordinary finish with an ever-changing character that gives you something new with each breath. Something burnt there that I do not love but everything else is spectacular. Fiery smoke & peat loaded arrival red fruit and Iodine packed middle followed by long slow rich oily thick mouth coating vegetal finish. L12 331 13:50 6ML  My review of Uigeadail. I can't tell you what lot number this is, but i tasted this, December 2013. Nose: plenty of typical Ardbeg, smoke peat, road tar, coal fires, brine and a healthy dollop of salt but there is more to it, vanilla, sticky date pudding and loads of citrus too there is immense depth. With Water: big hit of pepper the rest is still there, although the richness is lessened. Maybe there is more peat? Pallet: viscous and oily, dark chocolate cocoa then sticky sweetness, smoke and peat a lot of spices all sorts of pepper, chili more salt and citrus. With Water: more sherry, dates definitely, also figs, caramel too, this is amazing. Ardbeg is still around all the fire and brimstone you could care for, but there is complexity, contrast as well.  Finish: sweetness comes back and lingers, there is peat too but the finish is smooth rather than (slightly) violent, brine and dark chocolate and over extracted coffee. With Water: chocolate, pepper, peat and maritime notes, smoke as well, just lasts and lasts Mark: neat – 8.5, with water – 9.1 A great whisky, a modern classic. Lovely stuff Appearance becomes a bit cloudy with water, almost like an unfiltered Hefeweizen. Drinking it out of a snifter makes for a very different (better) experience, than drinking from a standard scotch glass. From scotch glass, splash of water: Nose-21: light and misleading, leather, black pepper, apricot jam Palate-23: fruit, old wooden trunk, cold dry soil, peat, smoke, cooked brown sugar Finish-24: Complex, two-tiered, light smoke, and syrup, then heavy peat, and (mesquite?) wood Balance-22: the complexity of this scotch may be outside of my pay grade, but it certainly took me for an enjoyable ride Overall-90 From snifter, larger than average splash of water Nose-23: Potent, nostril-clearing, cedar, mint, iodine, light-peach? Palate-21: Heavy pronounced Peat, honey, sweet marzipan, sassafras root syrup, table salt Finish-24: light smoke and peat, then a pause in flavor before a wave of heavy smoke that tingles on the tongue rolls through Balance-23: dramatic changes from one flavor to the next, imposing, but never unpleasant. Overall 91 Not sure about the bottling code. The market code is 13001713 and it was acquired in Chicago (bottled in 2013).  Nose: soft and alluring, with pronounced sweet fruit, smoke, and ash. Palate: you know what...it was just OK. Honey and ashy smoke combine, honey-citrus, then astringent peat with mild honey. Love the ubiquitous honey undertone.  Finish: spice and mild citric acidity with lingering mild honey.  Overall, a balanced and competent malt. Slightly too astringent on the palate but nice overall. It didn't really wow me or blow me away, though I am comparing a relatively recent bottling to my expectations, which are certainly based on previous bottlings on which this malt has built its massive reputation.  I have never been too big on peated whiskys. This has now changed... The Ardbeg Uigeadail offers quite a trip. Big, exquisit flavors and really alot going on. The color of this particular batch is quite light, golden wheat.  Nose: Very interesting. I get leather, peat smoke, sligtly bitter dark sugar, manure and moss.
Some time in the glass really allows the sweeter notes to develop and after about 15 minutes i get christmas pudding, a hint of maple syrup, toffe. With water it gets even more sweet. Sweet licorice and perhaps the sherry comes through a bit. Water takes the edge of the nose, its not alcoholic but quite strong given the high ABV. Palate: Warming, Oily, old seasoned leather, licorice, peat smoke, sweet dark treacle. As with the nose the sweeter notes develop after some time out in the air. With water the sweet licorice comes through quite alot, almost anise.  Finish: The smoke is evident from the get-go and really builds up but there is alot more going on. I find leather, unspecified sweetness - treacle?, tobacco. The finish is quite complex and the character changes a couple of times. It really lingers on for a very long time. After awhile i notice something almost like grilled pork.  Now I know you are all very interested in the batch number to be able to identify this particular bottle. It was bought in Sweden and the batch nr. is L14 094 0905 6ML.  When I first opened and tried this, I was looking for a smoke experience. I got it and then some. If I had reviewed this back in May, it would have been that it's a challenging drink, but worth it on occasion. Now the bottle has been open for a few months, and my palate has tasted many more offerings. I'm happy to finally review this whisky and say, buy it. Enjoy it for the roller coaster ride it offers.  Still not a daily drinker by my taste, and not as cozy as my beloved Lag16, it is still a must have for many whisky lovers. Amazing stuff.  Colour: Amber Nose: Oak, Smoke, caramel Palate: Oak, smoke, raisin, sweet, medicinal, bitter Finish: Oak, raisin Very good overall - a bold yet relatively well-balanced whisky. I did notice some undesirable medicinal notes however and there was a bit of a burn near the finish.  Compared with similar whiskies (such as the Laphroaig PX Cask that I reviewed recently) I think it is less delicately balanced and smooth. It also had less intense sweetness and raisin aromas. Would suit those who don't like the sherry casks to steal the show. I was on a big tasting with Magnus Fagerström and we tasted 25 different ardbeg. Look at www.magnuswhisky.com/whiskyklubben-slainte, and that was Amazing. So even if i tasted a lot of old ardbeg i Think Uigeadail is one of the best compared with the price. The Uigeadail has been a blank spot on my whisky resume for quite some time now, as the Ardbeg distillery still remains barely charted territory, after I had some misconceptions about the distillery, due to my first encounter with a bad batch of Ardbeg 10yo. Nose: fairly simple actually, not too complex: fresh quite medicinal peat fresh from the moors, deep smoke, humid dark forest soil, scents of iodine, rough ground black pepper underlying tones of sherry, almonds, honey, with a whiff of vanilla.  Taste: tar, salty liquorice,lemon peels, tobacco; quite the biter, (with water) honey,walnuts and surprisingly enough lemon cheese cake?  Finish: long as it lingers in your mouth for a few minutes with notes of tar, black pepper, cigar smoke and raisins. The finish will leave you with the feeling that you've just smoked a fine cigar Conclusion: wow, this was a great dram, I already regret not trying this earlier, I've been a fool. This puts Ardbeg right into my top 10 distilleries. I'm not a firm believer in the terroir aspect of Scotch, but the three Kildalton distilleries sure do make some extraordinary, guess I'll just have to pack my bags and retire to Islay permanently, who knows maybe they'll need a still-man in one of the distilleries.  This batch is from May 29 2013; bought and opened 11/12/13. So this is the most recent batch of Uigeadail I have found in Virginia . . . my advice is skip it. On a recent cold winter night I put it up against two other Uigeadail batches: my favorite batch L11 028 and the recent L13 058. Again, I score each bottle in 5 categories comparing all three bottles as I go. I add those score together to get my final score. On this particular night L11 028 scored 97; L13 058 scored 90; and this new guy L13 149 scored 86. Since that night I have scored in on several other occasions. All the scores have been around that score (85, 86, 83, and 84). I will go with 85 for a final score.  Nose: Much more varnish and spirity notes then 058. There is obviously peat and wood notes, but not the depth or the sherry presence that 058 has – doesn’t even compare with the 028. It has a lot of that “new Ardbeg” sour lemon going on. Not as bad as it could be, but enough to keep it from “greatness.” It does have a little bit of that dark Ardbeg thing going on: dark bitter chocolate, dark earth (not moist; dry), and some dried seaweed. It is still Ardbeg - and so enjoyable for me – but not up to the standard I expect. Taste: Strong saccharin sweetness – high sweet tone. Now some lower bitter wood tones, some sea salt, and a bit of leather. Very interesting how the “bitter wood” notes have taken that sweetness down a ton. Maybe some liquorish notes? This really doesn’t remind me so much of Ardbeg or Uigeadial as it does Lagavulin – but without the smoke. Finish: Nice wave of peat . . . and now a wave of sea salt and fire. The waves keep rolling in. I will give it to freshly opened Ardbeg . . . it knows how to throw a finale. It is big fire and peat in a young muscle bound kind of way. It leaves the mouth the most decimated and dry of the three batches tonight. That is worth something in my book!  As the bottle has been open for two months it has lost that power . . . and the finish score has dropped. Still, it is my favorite part about this batch. It has that liquorish note I usually associate with Laphroaig or Lagavulin - not Ardbeg. Complexity, Balance: Not all that complex on the nose. I am almost tempted to think that something is off here – it is so spirity! And it is very two dimensional compared to the other L13 and the L11. It is a poor example of Uigeadial. It is all raw young spirit that maybe didn’t have enough wood to balance it out. Or perhaps just a bad cut? Who knows (not me). What I can say is that this batch does not come together.  Aesthetic experience: I love the Uigeadail bottle. It use to have a slight edge over the Corry for me . . . I like the name and label of the Uigeadial better. I like the ABV of the Corry (and then nick name) better. Are either perfect? Probably not, but they are dang close.  Conclusion: Yet another disappointing batch of Uigeadail. That is two bad batches for 2013. My hope is to find another good batch soon . . . I am itching to stock up on a good batch of Uigeadail as I am down to my last unopened bottle of L11 028! But this batch is not it . . . avoid. All that said . . . I still love Ardbeg. And I would gladly drink this batch over the vast majority of single malts out there.  This was a birthday gift from my wonderful girlfriend. She knows that I love big flavours, with peat and sherry being favorites. It seems only natural that I’d want to give this a go. Of course not everyone thinks peat and sherry should marry. At least they didn’t use to. Now, with the Uigeadail, people seem to be appreciating how dynamic and wonderful a couple they can be. People love this stuff, and it has an almost cult-like following in the world of whisky. Does it deserve all of this regard and status? Well, it may not be a godsend, but it is a damn fine whisky by any standard. Nose: While peat and sherry are at the core of this whisky, the coastal/island character is also quite noticeable here. Salt, sea air, and seaweed are here. Raspberry jam, cherries, lemons, marmalade, honey, soft vanilla, and lavender. Very nice wood notes, with cedar, pine needles, and dark, wet oak. Lovely waves of earthy peat with that signature semi-medicinal tinge. Very rich and layered. Palate: A silky texture greets us. Very nice mouthfeel. Salt and sweetness are nicely balanced here. The peat comes on in a very powerful but controlled manner. Black pepper, faint coconut, licorice, honey, and cotton candy. Finish: Lovely, long finish. Raspberry jam, black current jam, cherries, roasted barley, burnt toast and just a bit of oak. The smoke is sweetened by the sherry and has a fruity/industrial flavour that’s somewhat hard to put into words. This is long and lasting, with the individual flavours subsiding at different paces, making the finish very dynamic. When we write reviews, we want our own voices to stand out. We want fresh ideas and new perspectives. Well, sorry folks. I’m going to say roughly the same thing that almost everyone else says. This is a damn good whisky. This has been opened for two months, and I’m noticing a good deal of evolution happening. Definitely vibrant. For me the biggest strength here is balance. Many sherry/peat marriages are troubled. The sherry notes can become candy-like in response to the peat presence. Although rarely unpleasant or cloying, they can occasionally steal the spotlight from the peat presentation. Not so here. The peat is big and bold enough to keep the sherry from candying up the whisky too much. That’s not to say that the sherry plays second fiddle here. Simply that it is controlled. There are two big flavours in here, but they aren’t competing against each other, they’re working together. The result is an interesting, evolving, and dynamic dram if ever there was one. Side note: This is an Asian bottling of the Oogie, and has no code on the back. I don’t know anything about its year or batch number, unfortunately. There are literally dozens of reviews for this expression. I am not going to say anything new or game changing. This bottle has been open 8 months. As an Islay fan it was on my wish list for a long time before finally getting my hands on it. I was drinking it tonight and went to check on my review to see if my opinion had changed... only to find i have never posted a review. So here are my thoughts.  Nose. Smoke, citrus, seaweed, peat, musty, brine, sherry, honey, vanilla, cedar and cinnamon bark. It is a complex and powerful bouquet which is elusive and changing.  Bonfire smoke is at the fore. Powerful, spices, warming caramel sweetness. Medicinal with malted barley, peat and brine.  Finish is oh so long, smokey, lingering with a peppery tail. Big flavours, punchy, complex, interesting. This is a desert island dram for me. One of the best!  I should mention, for context's sake, that my first single-malt was Laphroaig 18-year, which I absolutely love. I adore that camp fire meets early morning gas station odor and flavor and don't find it off-putting at all. In the interest of broadening my horizons, I researched and decided to try Ardbeg Uigeadail next, since everyone says such great things about it. I find that the peaty smokiness is far less pronounced on the nose and there is a distinct burning that comes from the alcohol and makes it difficult to ascertain what's going on underneath. On adding a splash of water, strong med kit odors come out. I noticed scents of bandages and Neosporin. On the tongue, it has a pleasant warm oiliness but again, the alcohol seems to really cut right through and overpower the experience. After adding water, I taste nothing but Band-Aids. Quite unpleasant, really. I won't be using this for anything but Munro baggers. I feel like in terms of complexity and character, the Laphroaig 18 year is much more enjoyable. If you want the most smoke that you can possibly get, this bottle won't deliver. Again, my palate is not the most sophisticated but I still get absolutely no inkling whatsoever of the Christmas flavors people rave on about.  Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. Ardbeg Uigeadail is named after the loch from which Ardbeg draws its waters and was launched in 2003. It is a vatting of Ardbeg expressions matured in both ex-Bourbon barrels and ex-Sherry butts and carries no age statement. The nose is briny and fruity, with bananas and lemons coming to mind first, accompanied by soft peat smoke. After a while the nose changes and becomes sweeter, with vanilla and caramel getting the upper hand. With water the nose becomes mellow and slightly rubbery. The palate is full-bodied and rich. Dark fruits and figs are followed by honey and a delightful nuttiness. Peat smoke comes into play alongside briny and phenolic elements. Adding water reveals smoked ham and brings out salty and earthy notes. The finish is long and very warming. Slightly peppery notes are followed by dark fruits and figs. Peat smoke, salt and brine round off the experience, together with smoked ham. By all means this is a wonderful single malt. I found the nose most fascinating as it changes markedly over time just by letting it breathe – quite extraordinary! The palate is luscious, with both peat and the fruity impact from the ex-Sherry butts vying for the top spot. However, be careful with adding water as too much of it will dilute the nose and kill off the salty and earthy notes that develop with just a few drops. A wonderful bottling, just one notch below my favourite, Ardbeg Corryvreckan. Here are my notes from a bottle I finished a few months ago: Size: Generous Dram in Glencairn N: Vanilla, peat, bonfire smoke, vanilla, kombucha. P: Dark chocolate, turbinado sugar, sherry, grilled asparagus, sea salt, almonds, burning peat, kombucha, ash, clotted cream, road tar, toasted barley.  The burn was hot due to a nice generous ABV. With a teaspoon of water the heat backs off and the sweetness rises with a bit of salt comingling with some sourness. Sweet and sour. F: Long finish with smoke, tart vinegar, waves of peat, and a little sherry. A fairly young tasting Uigeadail that did not impress as much as others I tasted first at the Highland Stillhouse, as well as at friends' houses. Not sure the code on those other bottles. The cork in my bottle was fine, no signs of rot. I find Ardbeg's corks to be quite good, generally speaking. I have tasted other Uigeadails prior to L12 216 that I would rate at about 91 or 92. How fitting that my first review on WC is the Uigeadail. While almost all Ardbeg bottling's have that distinctive peaty depth, this is one of my staples. I always have an Oogie on my bar. That bold Ardbeg Peat smoke almost guides you through a spectacular journey of Christmas cake, vanilla, coffee, toffee and that lemony tang that never dissapoints. In terms of complexity, I have yet to experience a bottle as consistently exciting and fun (NOT TO MENTION A FINISH THAT GOES ON ENDLESSLY). Bravo Ardbeg and Slainte! Nose: Nosed from a glencairn, no water added. Bottle is halfway full. Waxy sweet peat, ash and sour lime is dominant on the nose. Gentle hints of dark syrup, pear, caramel and abit floral.  Palate: Sweet peat, malty and moderate sherry influence. Salty, nice sweet and sour balance.  Finish: Wood tannins on back of tongue followed by nice waxy peat and bonfire smoke which cover the mouth. Aftertaste of smoke sits for a long time and gentle sherry. Very good full flavoured whisky. Abit pricey though at 140USD for 70cl, I can get Laphroaig QC and triplewood for 40USD less and I would rate them about the same. L13 176 In my reviews I never take water.. against my better judgement I have decided to stay consistent and leave the water for this CS Scotch. Nose: I can't work it out... but I will try my best. So It's sweet but peaty. I can almost smell the moors and hills of Scotland. A touch of raisin, linseed oil?? like you would use to prep wood and maybe a whiff of halloween honeycomb. Too deep for me to fully understand.... will buy a second bottle to re evaluate in a few years. 17 Palate: Wow, its CHEWY! Leaving my tongue smothered in lusciously warm oils. Not as sweet as I expected... definitely a twang off barbecue sauce followed by a flood of dry smoke. Peat, peat, peat.Tantalisingly good. Powerful flood of alcohol but well rounded and not off putting ... I have been saddened in the past by weaker whiskies having a rough alcoholic edge but this one is well rounded and surprisingly comforting. Manuka honey is present on the roof of the mouth and teeth. Rich and unrelenting. 24 Finish: Long. Very dry, and honey smoked. My favourite finish of any whisky I have tried. My tongue and mouth is still engulfed in its wonder almost 5 minutes later. 24 So the nose put me off... thats right I couldn't quite get on with it. I was disappointed I must admit.. that was until I took up the courage to taste. I now understand the reviews. It's complex and full of character .... unlike anything I have ever tasted before. Bad review I know but I have nothing else to praise or critique. It makes for a wonderful and special dram. Lives up to the translation of its name. I continue on my long and enjoyable search for a scotch I can review at 90. The ardbeg uigeadail is named after the source from which the distillery gets it's fresh water. The other part of the title suggests the iconic status this bottling has achieved, i for instance, rate the uigeadail from '08 as one of the best peaty malts i've ever tried. It is an icon also for having been very consistent over the course of it's existence. Which brings me to the whisky i am reviewing today, this is the 2013 Uigeadail, the one you would get if you bought one now. You would be happy to know that not much has changed. Nose: Big boat&road tar, honey, toffee and cola-cubes. Glögg and/or Gluewine over a fresh spring-nite bonfire. Seashore, seashells and it loses some of the peppery complexity on the nose compared to earlier versions, bit of a shame. The Peat is big and present throughout, but never interfering too much with the rest, smoke is swirling around all the scents. Palate: Honey-sweet iodine arrival followed by a big peat rush. Feta-cheese with honey-suckle (manuka honey). Juicy citrus and toffee appears swiftly. Now the peppers come in with wood-peppers, ginger and even a faint wasabi note, interesting! Finish: Juicy malt makes an appearance with even more Peat, smoke from a closeby beach bonfire and salivating, tannic, warm, juicy, sherry. This prolonges itself in a durable fashion to define the finish. A modern classic that holds it's head well above ground, this malt is a steal although Ardbeg's have become more expensive with special releases left&right alongside older collector bottlings, all the while the 10 year old has gotten more expensive due to circumstance. All things that makes this malt so attractive, this really is the pick! Mostly though because of the taste that seems eternally big&steady! A south-islay Giant! Nose: Sharp and sweet nose. Super sweet high tones here: soprano. It is sharp, singes the nose hairs, and dances off . . . lovely. The sweet tone is strong, but underneath is an alto pitch of sour to give it an interesting balance. The peat is down in the baritone range with the smoke acting like a bass . . . a presence that is felt more then heard.
There is some earth, tar, peat, coal, tree bark, and wet fence post. A bit of fruit cake if you really search. Now it turns malty and cookie dough-ish with some chocolate. There is a very fascinating balance of road asphalt and sweetness – earth and sea. Now the fruit: yellow nectarines, lemons, and white peaches. Now the sweetness is turning chocolate-ish . . . and now it is turning creamy. This is by far the most elusive and dramatically changing nose of the night: it never seems to sit still. Now it is back to smoky ash. It is probably because this is a freshly opened bottle for this tasting. It has been in the glass for almost an hour now (with a lid on it) and every time I check back in things change around. Formaldehyde, leather straps, and now blueberries and jam . . . now oregano and herbs emerge along with lemon zest and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Over all this has a wonderful range of flavors and seems ever changing . . . but this nose doesn’t create any mental images or take me anywhere like the L11 028, L10 151 or the L11 147. So super complex . . . but other batches were more enjoyable. Taste: High sweetness mixes with sour: semi-sweet chocolate covered cherries, lemon rind, black earth, tree bark, seaweed, oak, and peat bog. Interesting balance of super tart and sweet: peat and smoke: salt and wood. Turns to lemon and sea salt. This is a nice decent Ardbeg.  Finish: Big intake of breath . . . now comes the wave . . . not as big as I had expected but it is powerful and peaty. Now the waves come in. It is one wave after another; each growing more and more powerful - like the tide coming in. This is a super-long finish. Tons of flavors happening: seaweed, sea spray, charred oak, peat moss, leather, white sand, lemon, and hints of fish. Tons of peat, salt, and light fruit: smoked nectarines, pears, and lemon rind. Very much a peat, fruit, and smoke ordeal with the obligatory sea salt . . . that goes on and on. Complexity, Balance: One of the more complex Uigeadails. Very elusive: all these interesting smells and notes behaving in some kind strange dance. Not as well balanced as some of the others. Everything seems to be in an epic battle . . . or slam dancing, but then I tend to like that in a whisky . . . Aesthetic experience: Close in color to the L11 028 but a hair lighter.  Nose: Deep and rich. Chocolate and fruits. Dark black earth and peat, now it changes to candy canes and mint – but just for a second. Tons of spices. This is a great bottle. This tone is a very rich baritone. Not the most powerful Uigeadail, but that makes for a fantastic intimate venue. Digging in you get to the intense black cherries, leather, with a distant log fire. This is all about chocolate covered dark fruits: there is a rich cake smell – chocolate dates, black cherries and prune cake. Sounds strange and decadent. You really have to tune in and focus to appreciate this one. If you are not in the right mind frame you could easily pass over it. My guess is there is some old Ardbeg in here.
Reading Jim Murray’s review of this particular batch of Uigeadail (it was this batch that he awarded a 97.5 and named it 2009 World Whisky of the Year) I am finally beginning to pick up on his “style” of evaluation. He describes this nose as “hinting” at all kinds of things (“A hint, but no more of . . .”). And I see what he means: this is a very subtle Uigeadail nose – easily the most subtle Uigeadail batch I have tasted. Nothing really stands out or takes a dominating role. It is like a symphony playing at mezzo-piano. Or like a painting such as Impression, soleil levant (Impression: Sunrise) by Moet. This is a work of art in impressionism. And while I can appreciate this delicate nose I tend to prefer a strong nose that is fortissimo (perhaps Picasso’s Guernica?). I like my Ardbeg boarder line offensive and painful (with depth and flavor). Water brings out the woody notes and a bit more peat. This is better in its style (if you like balance) with water. Taste: Sweet mocha and fruit. Very light and delicate on the tongue: juicy and sweet. Near the end a faint hint of bitterness? Just as you swallow. . . . was that a bitter note? Ya, it is just there for a second . . .  Finish: Big finish. Something almost slightly bitter and off here just as you swallow it . . . but only just. You are left with bittersweet coco, leather, and peat embers. This is very salty with tons of peat fire. Over all a lovely finish that for me has a slight bitter bump between an enjoyable taste and a delightful finish. I will have to revisit this one again in the near future.  Complexity, Balance: Huge points for balance. This might be the most balanced Uigeadail I have ever tried. Complexity is right up there with my most favorite batches. But it doesn’t beat down the door with its complexity (like L13 058 and L11 028). The only negative point is the slight bitterness between the swallow and the finish . . . it was a only a split second . . . Aesthetic experience: This is the darkest and looks the sexiest of the bunch I have reviewed (2007-2013 . . . with earlier batches to follow). Sample graciously provided by @Victor from a bottle opened that day. Nose: Very dry. Deep and rich peat smoke with tons of high sparkly bits going on. This is amazing. The fruit is very much in the background here. Much more smoked meats. The harmony between the peat and fruit errs much more on the peat side (which I like). The fruit is light stuff like pears and smoked peaches. Amazing intensity! More intense then any other batch this night. This is very alcohol-y in a way I love! Tons of high notes: sherry, peat, asphalt, and some diesel oil. This is the polar opposite of the L7 325. This is a bright rich high soprano with tons of power and volume. There is this wonderful soot and that asphalt smell I associate with classic Ardbeg. Now lemon citrus and bright cherries come in. Truly fantastic. Takes water very well. It brings out the light fruit tones of green grapes, pears, and green apples.  Taste: Sweet in a sugar-in-the-raw kind of way. Lovely on the mouth – silky and smooth. Tastes amazing. Super high sweet peat notes. Fire. Nothing off. Highest sweet tones of the night (but not the sweetest), and the second most intense (after the L11 028 by a nose). Finish: Huge Ardbeg intake of breath . . . seems to last forever . . . now comes the tidal wave. It is a low cresting wave over your body. Wonderful peat, pine sap resin, caramelized sugar, mint, . . . amazing. If the 028 tasted like the color purple then this is the color yellow. Now, some maritime notes of salt, seaweed, and fish emerge. Wonderful: simply amazing. Complexity, Balance: I might say one of the less complex of the night, but the most Ardbeggy of the bunch. Most of the complexity is found on the finish (Some bits on the nose; very little on the mouth). The balance is wonderfully Ardbeggy in its intensity. However, it doesn’t have the balance of the L7. Aesthetic experience: Very light compared to the L7 325 or the L11 028. Perhaps a lower proportion of sherry matured casks. This is one of the lightest of the bunch; about even with L11 284 Nose: Sharp high notes of sherry and peat greet your nose while a deep rich powerful fruit notes gurgles in the background. Oranges, raisins and plumbs mix with cinnamon and other spices dancing over deep rich peat. This is very velvety and earthy. This is a deep sherried nose, but in a different fashion from the L11 147. It is like a dark purple velvet curtain is enveloping you. Wood smoke in the background and a dark deep black earth peatiness undergirds everything. Formaldehyde, tobacco, and leather gloves make an appearance. This is a baritone peat tone. The smoke lives a bit higher up, but not as high as the L13 058. Still, really intense with a ton happening up high: now mint and pine sap resin emerge. Smelling the L11 147 next and coming right back to this one brings out chocolate along with the oranges in this nose. The chocolate is really strong now: dark chocolate, oranges and fruit on a bed of peat. This one gets an edge for a level of evolving complexity, power, and sparkle that every other batch just kind of lacks. This nose always takes me to a very specific place: a room surrounded by purple velvet curtains. It is a cross between an old English-manor-house-library and, a scene from a David Lynch movie. It feels both eerie and comforting . . . I feel like I am in the North West but still ensconced in velvet. This is the smell of purple in a glass framed in black and forest green. I love it. When the nose of a scotch can evoke my imagination into a crystal clear image I know that it is a special whisky. This is such a dram. Taste: Chocolate covered fruits dipped in liquid peat. Lovely dark plumbs, baked red apples, and prunes all on a piecrust of peat and earth. Very sweet, salty, tart, bitter, and then back to sweet. Definitely, this is one of the sweeter batches. Nothing overwhelms. It is amazing! Now some salt and heat . . . it is growing very big and wonderful. Smoke and peat are emerging to dominate.  Finish: Huge Ardbeg intake of breath . . . now comes the scalding wave of peat. It pulls everything out of your mouth into a gigantic hole . . the dead sea now in your face. Peat, wood, fruit, seaweed, smoke, and the ocean with engine oil floating on the surface. Lovely. Perhaps the most smoky batch of the lineup. Tons of peat and fruit: the fruit is dark and rich where the peat and smoke are powerful and strong. Love it. A very interesting hint of liquorish – anise? Oak, smoke, peat, cereal grains, and animal feed with a bit of rusted metal. Biggest finish of the night. Complexity, Balance: Extremely complex. This is about as complex as Ardbeg can get for my money. And the balance is fantastic. What it tells you on the nose you get everywhere else. Everything comes out for a solo like in a jazz group.  Aesthetic experience: Third darkest color in the current lineup. The L7 325 was obviously the darkest with the L11 147 being a slight bit darker then this batch. Nose: Tart and sour quickly greet the nose. It is a lemon lime thing: almost a sour mix. This tart note dominates with a little bit of earth and peat seeping in around it with a healthy bit of lemon rind. As you dig deeper you get to the earthy sea salt that is typical Ardbeg – but it is very hidden. Most sour batch of Uigeadail I have tried. Seems to lack the power of the others. The peat, smoke, and earth tones are there, but they are really suppressed by the sour lemon. This has almost no peat tone compared with the others. Also very little smoke – it is super high in the nose and very thin. Everything seems all jumbled together. There is sweetness here . . . but nothing really stands out.
With water: more lemon and less fruit – as if that were possible!  Taste: Artificial sweeter and tart apples. There is some peat and smoke in the background, but you have to hunt. Very sweet (saccharin) candied coated peat. Now the salt and peat take over: very sharp and intense on the mouth. No much change with water Finish: Huge traditional Ardbeg intake of breath . . . this is more of a bomb going off! It is more of an explosion then a tidal wave. You are left with sand, salt, peat, and radioactivity! There is some fruit, peat, a bit of wood, but mostly brine: hard to get much else over all the salt! For me the powerful finish saves this from a 70’s score. More wood with water. It almost goes down in score a bit.  Complexity, Balance: Least complex and least balanced of the night. Everything seems to mush together. The sour and sweet stand out in very weird ways. It is super sour on the nose, and then super sweet on the tongue . . . go figure. Aesthetic experience: Very light in color for an Uigeadail. Very close to the L10 151 Nose: Sweet summer fruits along with the dark fruitcake from Christmas: plumbs, figs, raspberries, blueberries, peppermint, candied apples, and fig preserves. The peat is there, but it is much more the foundation for the fruits. There is also some chocolate and honey mingling with the fruit. After going to my reference blend (Grant’s) I am picking up on some mustard and sour notes behind the beautiful sweet fruits (strangely, sometimes getting away from Ardbeg helps with “a balanced perspective”). This is extremely similar to the L11 028, but slightly more “orange” tone (whatever that might mean). With some time this is more earthy, mossy, and darker then the L11 028 – but with some patchouli oil. This 147 isn’t quite as sweet as the 028, and there is a bit more earthiness here. The sherry seems to be better integrated with the peat and smoke then the 028. I am a bit disappointed that the peat is playing such a background role to the sweet sherry here. It seems as though (from the color and the nose) that this has the strongest sherry interaction of the batches from 2011. This has a bass tone peat with a low level smoke. Very little in the upper register; everything is down low. Still, it is intense, strong, and powerful. If this were the taste of a color it would be the taste of orange-brown. This is not my personal ideal Uigeadail nose. However, it is still very enjoyable, intriguing, and complex in its own right. With water: Slightly more of the alcohol is released. It is more astringent then before. But also maybe a bit more peat is released? Either way, it is not as great with water.  Taste: Very sweet: sweeter on the tongue then the L11 028! There is sweet fruit forward followed by peat in the background. Sweet sherry, then peat . . . , and then more sherry. Also in the mix: stewed prunes, figs, dates, apples, oranges, lemons, and pears. There is nothing bitter, or off here. However it does possess a sour element (just not as sour as L13 058 and nowhere near the L11 284). Silky mouth feel; not too heavy. There is honey-coated fruit. Seems near the bottom of the group where intensity is concerned. This is soft and velvety with nothing off. Finish: It doesn’t have that explosion like some of the other batches. This has a very long intake of breath . . . then a plunge . . . like a great rollercoaster. The bottom doesn’t fall out, but rather, it drops you and pulls hard to the left as you descend into darkness. Now comes the iodine ocean wave of peat fire. It doesn’t crash over you, but it carries you along a wonderful journey of peat fire, bogs, ocean current, and hickory smoke. Dark fruits mix with peat and wood chips. This is much more of a gentle peat swell to “biblical proportions.” The sherry is very present and intense for a very long time. The peat fire and the sweet sherry play around in a very interesting way. This is a very sweet finish. Not a bad finish in anyway, but not an in-the-face-Ardbeg like many of the others.
With water everything becomes a whisper. Complexity, Balance: Very complex with a ton going on here. However, it is all happening on a very low frequency. Has a great deal of balance, but not quite as great as the L7 325, or L11 028. Seems to have the most (or second most?) sherry influence next to/along side the L7 325. It is also probably one of the more subdued of the Uigeadial batches. Most similar batch to the L7 325. Aesthetic experience: Second darkest of the night after the L7 325. A beautiful combination of sweet influences and peat. Here's a lot going on from saltiness to sweetness and all kinds of wet burned wood in between. It's like being in a sauna with sherry on the coals...  A result of a visit to the whisky exchange shop in London (highly recommended if you're in town).  The nose is what's fascinating to me with this bottle. Not the greatest nose ever but it hides it's character so well. You initially think you're sniffing a rich highland, Islay character is well in the back until it hits your mouth. Nose - Young, fresh pine and oak wood with big alcoholic/varnish hit. Marshmallow, pear, melon and green apples. Peat is there but you almost have to go searching for it. Great complex stuff. Palate - Initial toffee sweetness with the pear and melon, followed by a dry oak meshed with peat smoke. It's immediately complicated but well balanced. Smoked fish and medicinal tongue numbing. Not as sweet as the 10 from what i remember. Some sea salt and then dark sugar returns. I know it's finished in sherry casks but thankfully this is perfectly married. It lends to the sweetness but does not rule like in many sherried drams. It's perfectly delicate and at the same time robustly masculine.  Finish - Long and incredibly dry which I love. Round and satisfying. Almost perfect balance of salt, toffee and smoke. Minutes later the notes of sweet wood and mild antiseptic are still arriving in waves. This is a well reviewed and loved whisky and for good reason. It's a classy/powerful bottle no doubt. Ardbeg Uigeadail turned out to be just as good as everyone was talking about it. Though bottled at cask strength, I still managed to make it brilliant for my taste with few drops of water (I usually don't like the strengthy ones). Uigeadail was like the movie Seven. I could've used this reference for many other whiskies as well but I wanted to wait for the right moment. And with a track record of 11 over 90 point whiskies so far, I'll make the reference now. Ardbeg Uigeadail was in many ways very dark, just like Seven. Like Seven had lots of rain scenes and a touch of the well known burning sensation in the story, 'uige' had the usual Ardbegian salt and smoke in it. Uigeadail managed to offer some nice tension between sweet and smoky spots. Just like Seven managed to offer some laughter into it's dark story through the tension between Mills and Somerset. Especially in the scene where Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman, is invited to Mills' house for dinner. After taking few sips of Ardbeg Uigeadail, I could easily relate to all the modern day deadly sins: Feeling lust for the smoky tar and experiencing gluttony with the sugary peat.  Feeling greedy and lazy — wanting all the bottles from my local liquor shop and laying at my sofa all day drinking them. Feeling wrath and envy for people who still have a Uigeadail in their cabinet...mine's finished. Being too proud of the fact that I've tasted a whisky this great and I know it's that great...pride is actually something that the makers of this whisky should feel as well.  Nose: Nice touch of smoke and tar that slowly fade away and keep dropping by, like nosing a slowly burning driftwood. Sugar and peat are the main characters here, with barley and wee salt. Taste: Fruity malt which has a very powerful peat and a touch of honey. After the addition of water I got nice tones of crisp and smoky licorice. Finish: Long, dry and peaty. Hints of smoke and sugar come flailing away in the aftertaste. Balance: In great balance with a big finish. Complex, especially for a smoky dram. The sherry influence is nice. I would not have imagined that the smell of smoky, rubbery, sweet rose petals would make my mouth water, so this must be a special mix. It took me a long time to analyze this, because there is something very familiar about it I could not identify, while at the same time it's very full and you could identify a hundred components. Nose: When warmer and new, very much flames and ash, coupled with tobacco and rubber; a raisiny sweetness makes these industrial scents more palatable. If a little cool, not too smoky and the first impression is as if you could smell a sour cherry ice cream: lightly sweet rose, creamy vanilla, faint but deeper notes of dark chocolate bits... and definitely all overlaid with charred walnuts, to impart a more serious aroma. Palate: Much of the same from the nose (floral/cherry/vanilla/nut/ash), in a potent and syrupy blend. Additionally, some hotness and acidity, like biting into a crisp red pepper maybe further dipped in tabasco sauce-- and then evolving into a thick and deep mole sauce. It is certainly intense, but never losing its smooth sweetness, and somehow never being too much of any certain theme of flavor. Finish: Long and rich, with the overtones of tar and ash passing into lingering raisin & clove sweetness, and finally a little tobacco/cigar while you enjoy nutmeg sprinkled on mocha cappuccino. This is obviously exemplary, and I mostly applaud it for being able to provide such complexity across a large flavor spectrum while avoiding bitterness or other extremities. Although different in tone, I can best contrast it with the Bowmore 15-Darkest, another peated sherry malt. In comparison, the Uigeadail does manage to come out smoother: with less toffee sweetness but more vanilla creaminess and walnut musk; with more apparent flames but less woody cedar bitterness. And the Uigeadail leaves me feeling I can find more subtleties the next days after.... It must be all those vowels. To smell; a medicinal smoke to start; bursts of antiseptic, lashings of band-aids, sprinkle on a little pepper. Mixing in with the smoke rather than distinguishing itself is salted cashews(these tend to always pop up for me in Ardbegs), and plenty of herbs, as well as suggestions of something meaty (those little bacon bits you put in Caesar Salad?).  Given some time in the glass an evolution occurs, something is fighting this uncompromising thick and smouldering smoke. Creamy vanilla gasps for air but the smoke quickly reels it back in. A toffee-caramel screams for help but its cries fall on deaf ears. To taste; I’m thinking a BBQ on a hot summer day by the ocean, a thoroughly burnt to a crisp sausage with a hot sweet chilli sauce on top, maybe tasted while chewing on a Redskin and puffing on a cigar next to a newly tarred road, all of the above mixed in with the taste of salty sea air. It sounds all fairly pleasant but imagine the salty sea air and cigar notes are a jab and the burnt sausage/tarred road is a left hook.  It makes sense to me, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t to you. Scratch that, even I don’t understand where i was going with that. A head-scratcher to be sure. Powerful and assertive, yet strangely approachable, be mentally ready for the kick in the taste buds and no one will get hurt.  Ardbeg distillery gets its water from Loch Uigeadail, hence the name that was given to this when it was launched in 2003. Apparently this whisky was born from a comment by Michael Jackson a couple of years prior that he wanted a ""dirtier"" Ardbeg than the just-released Lord of the Isles. The malt here is made up of 35-45% ex-sherry casks, the rest being ex-bourbon and ex-oloroso sherry. There is no age statement. The colour is medium-to-dark gold. The nose is not the burst of peat you might expect, but is still complex: soot, wet rubber boots, and castor oil - very herbal. Some chocolate notes, behind which I find hot asphalt and a burst of lime. This sounds overwhelming but it's not - the volume is low-to-medium and it's all perfectly integrated. More lime and brine with a few drops of water. The palate is sweet with the peat smoke taking over after 5-10 seconds in the mouth. Oily mouthfeel, smoked herring, lime cordial, salt-and-vinegar potato chips. As on the nose, water brings out a little more of that lime and brine. Amazingly complex and absolutely delicious. The finish is fairly short unfortunately - a little dusty with a slight hint of fish oil at the very end (but really improves with some water). Regardless, this is a spectacular whisky - definitely murky and dirty, as Jackson wanted it. I would be very happy to have this taste in my mouth 24 hours a day! One of the greatest of Islay malts. Jim Murray's 2009 World Whisky Of The Year. Note: I received this sample from @misslauren so I do not have the label in front of me. I presume the ABV is 54.2% as that is what I get from most sources, but Murray's 2013 Bible lists a 54.1% that he gives a lower score. So I could be wrong about the ABV of this sample, but I don't think I am. This whisky is a truly humbling experience. In the words of Wayne and Garth, “We’re not worthy!” The only reason I’m cluttering up the board with yet another Oogie review is that I’m on a mission to review every whisky in my cabinet. And the only reason I’m doing that is just to do it. As there are plenty of reviews that provide the history and background behind this masterpiece, I’ll keep this short and limit it mostly to tasting notes. Nose: Every time I take a whiff, I have an involuntary reaction of spasms in my gut, and I can’t tell if they’re from laughing or weeping on the inside. “Damn, that’s good,” I mutter as I take the Glencairn away from my nose, and my wife responds with “You must be having that Arrrrd-BEG (her pirate-ish pronunciation) you like so much.” Of course the peat dominates, but I’ve never smelled a peat so robust yet so smooth. Also sea air and traces of sherry and pepper. It’s not the most complex nose. Its strength is in its strength. Palate: Buttery, creamy, and oily upon arrival. Turns deceptively neutral quickly, but just wait. Within a few seconds, I get wood smoke, barbeque, old-fashioned rock candy, a bit of malt, and, of course, plenty of peat. The smooth finish grows and grows. All the aforementioned flavors are there and are joined by fruit punch and a nice meaty oomph that suggests…um, pork chops? The Uigeadail may be a cask-strength whisky, but I like it neat; or, at the most, with one tiny drop of water to open it up slightly. Two drops kills it. My bottle has been opened for about eight months and is now down to the ¼ level, but I haven’t noticed any deterioration. It remains one of the main reasons I’m glad I became a whisky drinker. Ardbeg Uigeadail (pronounced ‘Oog-a-dal’) is actually the loch from which all the peat-laden Ardbeg waters flow. For this expression though, it is a union of the classic smoky Ardbeg characteristics and ex-Sherry casks. There is an amber and gold hue...definitely darker than the 10 Year, but still a bit pale for how deep this one goes. All of the flavors are harnessed as this one is bottled at or near cask strength, and non chill-filtered…54.20% ABV.  Tasting Notes Nose: The pungent peat smoke sets the stage, but once it passes you by, there are layers. There are raisins, and an almost meaty scent, like cleaning a grill. Some water opens it up a bit (due to the high ABV) and it kind of smells like banana bread. Palate: Rich, and full bodied on the tongue. Complex…there is a lot going on here. It is sweet and spicy and hounded by a changing smoke, like charcoal now. More sweet fruits and cocoa on the way down, like chocolate covered raisins. Finish: Long, it takes minutes for the ashy smoke to fade. A bit of oak and sweet fruit (raisins) on the exhale. Conclusion This did not have quite the sherry punch I expected, but boy does it lend some sweetness! I am an admitted member of the Ardbeg Committee, and I always have an Ardbeg on my shelf. I can see what all the excitement is about as this one just leaves you gasping for air, and wanting more at the same time. Just a wonderful ride, and so balanced. If I had to pick an MVP here, it would likely be the nose. I literally stood there and just kept nosing it over and over and jotting down my notes as new things kept emerging. This is truly a gem…I don’t think that I could ever get bored of it Color: gold. Nose: this is ashier and peatier than the Lagavulin, but it shares that whisky's sweet, floral undertones. Not as sweet to me as others have reported though. Mostly this nose is very savory. I pick up smoked cheeses and salted sardines (my wife says bacon). Nothing overwhelming. Very balanced. Water brings out a little grapefruit. Body: full-bodied with a bite. Palate: lots of smoke. Probably the smokiest Scotch I've ever tasted. I actually choked on it with my first sip. After I adjust, I'm able to pick up more of the sweetness but still covered in smoke. Something like s'mores. Burnt marshmallow and chocolate. Finish: billows of smoke to the end with notes of chocolate and coffee. This whisky is an experience; not a passive drink. Honestly, I think it'll take a few drams before I really discover all it has to offer. The smoke is so heavy, it takes some work to move through it to the other flavors, and with the ABV as high as it is, doing the work before you fall asleep is a challenge! I really enjoyed this, and given some time, I may end up ranking it higher. But at the moment, I rank it even with the Laphroaig Quarter Cask (which is no insult). Not sure what else I can say about this little old whisky here that hasn’t already been said, one of my all-time favs so far in my short whisky journey. Love the balance between the peat and sherry; the flavors mesh so well together, dropping a bomb of flavor in your mouth. On top of that you get a chewy, heavy mouth feel whisky, two of my favorite attributes of a whisky, what’s there not to love about this one. Enough said…good night now! This is an amazing whisky!! Peat to sherry sweetness. Very complex, sophisticated, intense, and yet very balanced Scotch. Has all the characters of an Ardbeg 10 - peat, medicinal, campfire, iodine- and at the same time it has that sherry sweetness too.
Lovely dram.!! period. Ardbeg Uigeadail stands firm with a powerful presence. It took only a split second to validate the excellence of this scotch.  The nose suggests peat in light smoke consistently throughout. It is full and rich with a unique sweetness original to Uigeadail. Fresh seaweed flows underneath it all. The palate is heavy and oily and tames down this cask strength spirit. Smoke from the nose come through with more intensity and the sweetness lies in the peat. Black licorice and orange pith flirt and fade leaving a cloud of smokiness that lingers for a long finish. A fantastic dram! Fit to please the most demanding palate. Cheers! Peaty goodness, vanilla, stewed prunes comin' atcha! Yes, the body is huge and the palate diversifies into dark smoked chocolate, with some white wine vinegar perhaps, and a trace of gasoline fumes, along with bonnie heather. I also catch a passing whiff of the smell of farmers burning their fields in fall to purify the earth for the next crop in spring. In Oregon, the farmers, especially hay, wheat, barley, and lawn turf farmers, burn their fields and if you are not too close to the burning field, it smells delightful in the distance. The Beist was my favorite Ardbeg, but alas, it is no more.  Galileo is a pale shadow of Beist. It is less ""sucking on a charcoal briquette"" than Uigeadail or Corryvreckan, which is even stronger. I would like to try the Alligator at some point. I know in my heart of hearts that Ardbeg makes a great scotch, but my tastebuds just can't get past the tar and charcoal at this point. It tastes even more poisonous than most hard alcohol to me!  Wish I could have tried the Supernova, even though that was probably even even more ""scorched earth"" than the Uigedail. If the Galileo was cheaper, I'd buy a bottle even though I don't really love it because the complexities aren't in there for me. Still, it's quite good. This one takes a while to get acquanted with. Great dark,golden amber colour and nose, full of sweet and peaty smoke. tasted without water, a bit too hot as the 54% overpowers. Added a bit of water to calm it down and this really allowed the sweety/smokey flavour to emerge in balance with the alcohol. a nice warm sipper. If you read my last review, of Bunnahbhain 12, this dram followed that one. Sitting at an extensive bar, tasting new things... what an awesome night. So I was talking to the bartender and told him that I've never really explored a peated Islay malt before, so I asked him for his suggestion between the Ardbeg Uigeadail and the Coal Ila 12. He suggested the Ardbeg. Well, alrighty then Mr. Barkeep, lets do the damn thing! I'll take it. So he turns and climbs his rolling ladder to the very tip top, reaches for the bottle and brings it down. He pours me a rather healthy dram in a nosing glass, and leaves the bottle with me to continue my exploration. Arbeg Uigeadail (pronounces ""Oog-a-dal""): Nose: Holy cow, this is great... Smoked meat, heavy, calm, a ton of personality and swagger here, like John Wayne. What's the ABV here... reaches for bottle 54.2%?! Never would have known.  Palate: Oh this is good... it's very warm, smokey, coats the tongue nicely with a bit of a syrupy viscosity. A mouthful of campfire and smoked meat, light raisins and dried plums. Simply awesome. Looking at my notebook from my notes a couple nights ago, I wrote ""like taking a bite of smoked ribs with a bit of tangy BBQ sauce, all while sitting around a mesquite wood fire."" I am a huge, huge fan. Finish: More of that soothing warmth, smoke and meat. Some light hints at Raisins or other dried dark fruit. Maybe plum. It's all real subtle. Like a good BBQ sauce, those flavors aren't subtracting from the flavor of the main course, which is that awesome smoked meat.  This is one of those drams that takes you on a journey to a different time and place. I couldn't shake images of the Wild Wild West as I was drinking this - images of sitting around a fire at night, smoked ribs, mesquite wood. So great.  Balance: Amazing. Simply stunning. Not a single flavor out of place here... everything is remarkably tuned and refined, and I'm in love with this dram.  This is the most complex whiskey I've tasted so far. Amazing.  Nose is full of spice, citrus with hints of creosote, some iodine and honey. Not much smoke but peat is there.  Taste is full and syrupy with the spice taking front and center with orange and honey (maple?) I'm also noting some clove and cinnamon or/and ginger. The finish is very long with my mouth becoming slightly numb due to the high ABV.  I could taste this all night and I think my notes would change and lengthen each time. I guess this is good an excuse as any to keep this on my shelf and keep trying :)  Having always enjoyed the occasional dram, about a year ago I began to broaden my horizons and investigate the varied delights of this mysterious golden liquid called Whisky. With roughly a year's worth of exploration now behind me, I tentatively embark upon my first review. Even in my whisky infancy, the Ardbeg 10 was a staple choice, an old friend I would return to - which is appropriate, as it was first introduced to me by an old friend, and we have shared many a peaty dram by an open fire since. With this history, and a broader taste for Islay, I began my personal collection with the much acclaimed Uigeadail. The Ten will remain a favourite. How would the Oogie compare? Upon first opening the classic algae-green bottle, the aroma of fiery peat quickly filled the room. (Having been open for a year now, the potency of the nose seems to have diminished slightly - is this a typical phenomenon?) The fiery theme continued as the first dram was poured, the liquid a deep amber colour, that of a glowing grate. And now the bit I'm most nervous about... Tasting notes! I take solace in the fact that this is entirely subjective. Nose: Big peat, but not excessive. Oily and dank, an open fire in a damp pine forest. And spicy, cloves and cinnamon. It also reminds me of one of those historical information museums that pump out ""authentic"" rustic smells... Except the Uigeadail begs me to linger! Taste: To quote my wife, ""It's like drinking a bonfire!"" Smokey, fiery, with possibly some sweet rum and raisin? Man alive, then the spice roars in like an accelerant! Yet it remains astonishingly balanced throughout. I had no idea such extreme flavour could be delivered with such balance. This was a new experience for me. As the embers die down, it's chewy, so chewy, like munching on a bit of old boot. Finish: Long and leathery. Begins slightly salty, then bitter orange. Eventually all that remains is the warmth telling of the recent furnace. This is undoubtedly my favourite whisky to date. I love the power and balance. My ridiculously high score reflects this but allows for something even more astonishing to trump it in the future! Mmmmmm...... Peach cobbler in a Dutch oven over the coals. Maybe some of the coals blew into the cobbler, as there is distinct smoky goodness throughout.  Nose: it definitely changes after you've had that first sip or three. At first it is a bit harsh to the uninitiated, while lively with a strong whiff of alcohol and smoke. After tasting, the nose loses its smoke and edge and becomes sweet fruit with butternut. Christmas pudding, ginger, cinnamon cloves in front of the wood burning fireplace. Don't forget the slight salt and brine. It is faint, but there.  Palate: Oh boy! Spice comes in strong, and the brine comes out stronger than on the nose. Less smoke, more peat. Faint sweetness with a fruity hint.  Finish: Lots of spice through the long finish. Citrus lingers.  How does one even begin to review what is arguably the best single malt in the world from arguably one of the best distilleries in the world.  Of course the nose is peaty and full of smoke! But what a brilliant nose. Underneath all the pettiness lies the sweetest, most delicious aromas of a citrus pudding. On top are the salty, iodine sea waves that keep lashing the shore and give this malt the most delicious of all noses.  The palate is simply perfection. It is sweet. It is salty. It is strong. It is gentle. There is spice. There is sweetness. There are salty oils caressing juicy nectarines. I don't know where to begin. After tastes of tobacco and leather remind of sitting in a smoky gentleman's club. Exactly the kind of place where the Uigedail would feel right at home. Finally there is the faintest hint of aniseeds to round off what is most definitely the way whisky was intended to taste.  A year and a half ago, I tasted the Uigedail (say ‘oog-daal’) for the first time. It was the 2003 batch. Today, I am going to try the batch that was bottled on 12 March 2009. Wonder if there is a big difference. All batches, from 2003 and 2011, are bottled at a strength of 54,2% ABV. It is a mix of young bourbon casks and older sherry casks. Ooh, yeah, this is good. The nose reveals hardly any peat, but emphasizes the dark sweetness of the sherry cask. Vanilla, banana, some Arcane rum and even some nougat. Only then does the Ardbeg profile reveal itself in all its glory with some coastal elements (sea, salt and the like). On the palate, it is again the sherry cask that speaks the loudest. First the fruit in the form of caramelized oranges with icing sugar and some figs, before the peat and sea salt are allowed to come out. Dried fish and tar. A lot of liquorice. A rascal. Playful, naughty and strong. What is not to like? A wonderfully long finish on liquorice and figs, leaving you with a big smile on your face. The Uigedail was voted best whisky of the year by Jim Murray in the holy scripture of 2009. Sometimes he just gets it right. A cracker dram, if you ask me! And for that price? Around 65 EUR. Well, you just have to get that Ardbeg (unless you can get your hands on the Corryvreckan, of course). Nose: Peat and smoke, raw dark sugar, thick honeys, roasted malt, expresso, sweet fruits, rich sherry, toffee and caramels. Palate: Sherry sweetness up front, very large entry, very juicy fruits, honeys and dark sugur, roasted malts, peat rises and overthrows the sweetness with notes of big peat and smoke and earthiness Finish: Smooth Peat, milky expresso, dark sugur, honey, figs and some fruit, fading sweetness and smoke.  Awesome whisky. Though I have a funny story in that I've had this whisky from 4 different bottles and while 3 of the bottles where great (this review is for those bottles) 1 of them the sherry sweetness in it was really flat in comparison this bottle I'd have only given a mid to high 80, not bad but not anywhere near as good as the other 3. So just be aware of possible batch variation.  So my wife and I have been planning on going to the whisky bar in our city for months now. Every time we make plans SOMETHING always come up. I get called into work a day early, we can't afford to go out, a public holiday that we forgot about is occurring on the day we're going and they're closed or as just happened this last time around, my wife and I got sick. This has been extremely frustrating for me as this bar has quite a few whiskies I've been meaning to try for a while and so as the day was ending yesterday I was feeling a wee bit down. To the rescue comes my brother in law! I get a text message from him saying ""If you can't go to the whisky then the whisky shall come to you!"" A couple hours later my brother and sister in law arrive at the house and he brings with him a bag of whisky. In this bag are a couple whiskies I've never had before along with a couple I've tasted. Now the first 4 bottles of his collection I just recently reviewed. The Macallan 10 yr old Sherry Cask, Sazerac Straight Rye Whisky, Johnny Drum bourbon, and Lagavulin 16 yr old. The last bottle on the tasting block tonight was the highlight of the night: Ardbeg Uigeadail!!! Now as you may have noticed in my last review which was the Lagavulin 16 yr old, I'm not a huge smoke and peat head. Amusingly enough if you've ever had Ardbeg, pretty much any Ardbeg, you know it's ALOT of smoke and ALOT of peat hahaha. I poured myself a hefty dram as I was going to be tasting this tonight and tomorrow for this review. I handed the glass to my wife who took one whiff and went ""Whoa!! Burnt bandaids!!""  As I smell this dram I get sherry with smoke and peat and quite a bit of phenols. Now this is the second time I've had this whisky, both from the same bottle. At this tasting the bottle had been open for several months and was down to just a few drams left. At the first tasting smoke with sherry and TONS of phenols and burnt bandaids came through. As I immediately noticed this bottle has opened up and oxidized and the nose profile has changed abit. I'm very curious as to how the flavor profile has changed. My wife immediately declined to taste this bottle this time as she is very much not an Islay fan. So I'm blessed with just having this to myself! Now this bottle is sitting at around 108.4 proof. And it does have that taste but it's not overpowering. On first sip the peat jumps to the front of my tongue and then smoke with the phenols, specifically the burnt bandaids. There is the taste of sea air on my tongue and some brine. For sweetness the sherry shines through. This is quite an enjoyable whisky. I've not had the Ardbeg 10 yr old or the Corryvakin yet and I'm keen to try them after this bottle. I'd be quite keen to also try this bottle just after opening and see how the flavors differ. The finish is quite long with the alcohol biting quite abit and the smoke, peat and bandaids linger on the tongue for a while. This is a very nice whisky and another one I wouldn't mind having on hand when I really want to taste some heavy smoke. However the price might be a little out of my range for a casual bottle. This bottle sits at around $135 AUS and can be a little difficult to put your hands on over here. This is a good complex whisky, but I'd NEVER use this or any Ardbeg to introduce any whisky novice to Single Malts. Now the ratings on this review are given based upon a bottle that has been oxidizing for quite a while and does tempt me to buy a bottle or try a newly opened bottle as soon as I can get a chance! strong peat with a little sweet teaste. good balance. i like it. Nose: Peat-smoked bacon with maple syrup. Cherry pipe tobacco. Call me crazy... but I'm getting a fleeting whiff of rich dark ponzu sauce in here. Sweet rubber and a slight chalky note on the nose as well. Taste: Dang. I love this. The flavour invades the mouth... not a hostile takeover but a takeover nonetheless. Uigeadail is runnin' the show up in here! Rich, sweet, creamy, sweet malt and then BAM a blast of smoke coats the entire mouth along with a really pleasant heat. Like spontaneous combustion. This whisky is great neat, and not unpleasantly agressive considering the ABV%. Mingling with the peat smoke is chocolate and toffee and BBQ and pepper and pipe tobacco... oh my! Finish: Smoke and spice recedes but is always present. As it smolders the aforementioned sweet flavours really take front row center now and here the sherry makes its presence known, along with some and grassy notes-dry hay and sagebush. Some nutmeg and leather in there as well. Sticks around for a loooong time--and even then, it's still sad to have it leave.  A really complex peat and smoke monster. Very strong smoke and leather scent on the nose, with a definite marine tang. Almost overwhelming. Keeping a sip in the mouth brings out the sweetness and spicy pepper. Hints of vanilla at the back of the palate and leaves a leather aftertaste. Long, lingering smoke in the mouth. Really, though, a hard one to figure out on the first glass. I must keep sampling this bottle (purely for research purposes, of course). Intensely smoky. Reminds me of being at a barbeque. The palate is sweet caramelized oak with a flurry of fruits and then the pleasant spices come roaring out in full nutty splendour. Beautifully balanced. I had to try it a second time after a while and fell in love.  Nose: campfire, new leather, Smoke. Palate: Starts off sweet and then the smoke comes through. Intense, full, smokey flavor. Finish: long lasting and peaty with a hint of vanilla. A Delicious Islay. A couple of drops of water bring out more of the sweetness.  Simply the #1 Scotch I've ever had. I can't stop raving about it. Peaty, yes. Balanced, yes. Incredibly long finish, yes.  My all time favorite. If u see it, grab it. Sweet lemony pudding nose. Smoke and old leather shoes. Finish is long and rich. Served neat, cut and uncut. The pour is a little bit darker than the Ten and the Corryvreckan. Widely spaced, weak tears. Nose is much more spicy alcohol than the Ten or Corryvreckan. Almost as hot in the nose as Supernova.  Nose (uncut): Lots of ginger and Christmas spice. Mulled cider comes to mind. As it opens up I get coconut curry. Maybe very subdued smolder and fireplace. Smoke is nearly absent on this one. Toasted cherrywood. Spicy citrus and potpourri. New leather comes to mind, but a little too much spicy alcohol burn at 50% abv+. It is obviously complex, but it is tough to get all the complexities out with any water added.  Nose (cut): With water, the aroma becomes more grapefruit rind heavy with white grapes and gold raisins. Baked raisins and black cherries in some sort of dessert. Actually, quite delicious. Smoke is pretty much absent.  Taste (uncut): Very sharp and spicy alcohol with mild burn. Lots of wood tannins and heavy Christmas spices: cloves, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. A little oily and nutty. Taste (cut): Loses the heat and focuses pine, cedar, black cherries and raisins. Very nice wintertime Scotch.  Palate: Lightly viscous. Finishes with soft burn and mulling spice.  Overall, one meant to be appreciated and takes a lot of time to understand. Much harder to decipher than Ardbeg Ten or Corryvreckan and with more rewards to the patient than Supernova.  Nose: peat, iodine & phenol, strong cherrywood smoke notes, campfire and firm barbecue. With water, additional oaky vanilla comes through and sweet perfumey aromatics. Taste: distinctly smokey. Hardwood smoke and more of the phenolic notes and ocean water. Orange and cherry blossom and sweet vanilla. Soft sherry note in the background. Long finish and sits on the palate evolving over time. Body: full and rich. Slick on the palate. Overall: Worldclass and simply spectacular. Nose: Obviously peat, distinctly Ardbeg. As I nose this I can hear the crackling of burning wood. Very elegant. After the first initial sniffs, a nutty sweetness arrives. Almond nougat, almonds sauteed in butter, grilled lemons, sea air, a hint of sweet tea. There's another bit of sweetness that I keep wanting to describe as meringue cookies. This is peat and sweetness woven together beautifully.  Taste: The peat and sweet nuttiness create a flavor of roasted peanuts. Perhaps chunky peanut butter? Deliciously creamy and thick. The charred bits from a barbecue and brine.  Finish: Quite long and intense. Billowing smoke, medicinal, hot and satisfying.  This is my favorite Ardbeg and quite possibly my favorite Islay whisky. I was lucky to be in London when The Whisky Exchange had a bottle of Ardbeg Alligator to share, and while it's a wonderful whisky, I'm still convinced that the Uigeadail is the crown jewel of Ardbeg. Get it while you can! Nose: Smoky and peat. Leather. Salty ocean air. Raisin and Christmas Cake. Freshly brewed Espresso. Taste: Start out fairly sweet leading into a powerful smoke and peat. Finish: Very long and chewy Raisin. Mocha and sweet. This expression of Ardbeg is simply the best single malt Scotch I've had to date. It has all of the best attributes of typical Islay Scotches, but also has a uniqueness all its own that is a pure delight. The nose is peaty and smoky, with a hint of seaside air after a storm. The palate is complex and unique. There is definitely strong smokiness and the earthy peatiness that comes with Islay whisky. But there is also a subtle fruitiness and even hints of sweetness to it. Then it grows into a lovely (but not at all overwhelming) hotness the endures into the finish. The finish eventually mellows into a salty, briny flavor. This Scotch is strong and powerful, but worth every penny. It is a great representative of Islay Scotches while also having something to it that sets it apart. Ardbeg Uigeadail is my favourite malt whisky. When I tasted the first bottle which I bought in September 2010 I went back to the store 5 days later and bought 3 more bottles from the same store off of the same shelf, because I was astonished at how good the Ardbeg Uigeadail was, and I wanted to have that wonderful drink available for drinking for a very long time. Three months later, as my first bottle was nearing the end, I purchased 1 additional bottle from a different liquor store. When my first bottle was empty I opened the single lone bottle which I had purchased the most recently. I sipped first in surprise, then in increasing horror as I did not experience what I had remembered of the flavour and the feeling of my first bottle. Upon further tastings over a couple of weeks the second bottle continued to give me exactly the same less than impressive flavour as it had with the first taste of it. First I asked myself whether this was the flavour that I had experienced from bottle # 1 and maybe my taste had changed in the interval that had elapsed. Finally I decided that I should sample bottle # 3, which had come from the same shelf as the sainted bottle #1. Low and behold bottle # 3 tastes exactly like all of my memories from bottle # 1 and gives me the type of transcendent experience that leads me to rate this whisky at 98 pts. To bottle # 2 I would give about an 86 pt rating, decent, but not at all head of the pack, or close to being an all-time favourite whisky. Nose: for bottle # 1 & 3, the nose is very brightly perfumed, like carnations with rosewater, peat, pleasant sherry and some briny and medicinal elements. For # 2 the nose is duller, lower pitched, less floral, and sort of muffled in its expression.  Taste: for # 1 & 3 the sweet sherry and the strong peat, medicinal, and briny elements combine into an amazing bright integrated fabric. There is a sort of harmony being played out here between the very high soprano notes of the sherry, and the bass earthy notes brought out through the peat and the briny/iodiny elements. You can still taste some nice malted barley here, sort of closeted between the high winey and low earthy notes. For bottle # 2 the sherry notes fall completely flat. They are not soprano or even alto, but more bass-baritone range. The sherry here is not bright, is not very tasty, and does not offer the beautiful contrast to the bass note elements that is afforded in the other bottles. The overall effect of sipping # 2 is heavy, almost leaden. Finish: for bottles # 1 & # 3 the finish retains all of the spectacular flavours equally strongly for a very long time. For bottle # 2 the sub-par sherry flavour actually deteriourates somewhat into the finish, and becomes both sour and less tasty. The finish here is also rather long, but it is not balanced, and not so very pleasant.  Balance: # 1 & # 3 have everything going for them in all departments. Bottle # 2 is not very balanced, not nearly as pleasant tasting or as appealing to the nose, and then gets somewhat less appealing on the finish. At the end of this experience I am extemely optimistic about the quality of my remaining 3 bottles of Ardbeg Uigeadail, but am completely in doubt about what I will encounter if I am to buy an additional new bottle of that whisky. This experience has led me to reassess some others' lukewarm reviews of Uigeadail, or those who felt that it needed water to open up. I go to water as a last ditch attempt to find a way to enjoy a whisky when I am not satisfied with what comes straight from the bottle. Maybe those others were drinking from the stock of bottle # 2. The summary observation I make from this is to remind myself that whiskies are living beings and not standardized widgets off of an assembly-line. There are definite batch to batch variations, and sometimes bottle to bottle variations. Sometimes those variations are of a very significant magnitude and can make the difference between an outstanding whisky and one which is merely mediocre. (My rating is of bottles # 1 and # 3)  Oh yes indeed. Ardbeg is of course a must for all of us phenolophiles / peatmaniacs. Oh how I would like to go to Islay and pay homage (and money) to sample from the springs of eternal amnesia...but I digress (as usual) - this is a remarkable whisky - managing to meld the immense peatiness (you can smell this whisky metres away) it deftly contains, with a sherried richness of finish. Its around 56-57% and to my taste buds is all the better for bringing down to about 46-47% where the balance and flavour improve still further. The whole Ardbeg range is impressive. I have yet to try the Supernova 2010 but until then this is a serious swig of peatpotency to satisfy most people's peat cravings. Ardbeg. This is known for being one of the peat monsters of Islay. I haven't ever tasted an Ardbeg, so this is my first introduction. I am very excited! The Ardbeg Uigeadail is non chill-filtered and bottled at 54.2% ABV, and is described by the distillery as being""a special vatting that marries Ardbeg’s traditional deep, smoky notes with luscious, raisiny tones of old ex-Sherry casks."" Nose: Intense smoke, iodine and peat of a Laphroaig or Lagavulin. Coming back after the first taste, I am picking out more of the sherry characteristics that were undetectable at first. While it is definitely true that more comes out after a sip, it is also true that some whiskies need to rest for a few minutes to reveal some of their character. Whichever was the case, it is definitely showing off a bit more of its sherry influence now. Very enjoyable! Palate: Yum! Some of the medicinal flavor from the phenols is in there, but it is mixed with some fruitier and nuttier notes, that make this whisky swim in my mouth! Delicious. Some prunes coming out.  Finish: Very smooth finish, releasing more of the phenols that showed up on the nose. Quite long, indeed. I'm not getting a lot of ripe fruit on the finish, but just a faint hint.  Honestly, this is VERY similar to Laphroaig Cask Strength. In fact, in a blind taste testing, I'm not sure I could tell them apart. This one might be a bit smoother, and a bit fruitier on the nose. Perhaps.  This is a very good thing, as my bottle of Laph CS is nearing empty. I was looking at a bottle of Laga 12yr CS or Laph 18yr to replace it when it is finally gone, but no longer. This bottle of Ardbeg Uigeadail will fill that profile in my cabinet just fine. This is a monster whisky, no doubt. This is for those who have developed a taste for huge, powerful peat monsters, and enjoy the taste of medicinal brine in your mouth! I am already feeling like I smoked a cigar, and I've only drunk about 15ml of whisky! I like peaty whiskies. In fact, I love peaty whiskies. But I love complicated whiskies too, with layered flavours and intense characteristics. Uigeadail is not a complex whisky. In fact, it's a very simple whisky: peat (and lots of it) and sherry sweetness. Drank unwatered it's probably too rough and simplistic, but when you dilute it with a bit of (cool) water it turns in to an explosion of peat and sweetness that just made me go ""oh my god"" and left me wanting more and more of it. Despite its peat and alcohol strength it was remarkably smooth and easy to gulp down. I can't remember the last time I drank a whisky that was this good. The Uigeadail is named after the Loch from which the distillery takes its water for production and means ‘dark, mysterious place’. You pronounce it ‘OOG-a-dal’. It was matured on both bourbon and sherrycasks, making it a blended malt (previously vatted malt). In 2008 it was named Whisky of the Year and Jim Murray gave it 97,5 points in his bible.  This Arbeg Uigeadail sports a full gold color, but has a Brown sheen on it. Nice fat tears in the glass. The nose is very intense and complex. The younger bourbon cask are no match for the older sherry casks, though. The sweet peat and herring on the barbeque notes are overpowered by new leather, raisins and other dark fruits as well as furniture polish. Let’s not forget the silt! Adding water makes the vanilla come back to the fore. This dram is a sneaky splinter bomb. It rolls over the tongue without much fuss despite the ABV, but once behind the teeth, it explodes in a true palate of tastes. Lime, smoke, liquorice, vanilla, bitter marmalade of overripe oranges, soot from a recently doused barbeque or fireplace, topped off with some spices (chili). Adding water is not a good idea – it flattens the taste, but brings nothing new to the palate. Better not do that. The long finish is dominated by smoked ham and oak and dries the mouth. Wow, this is another very good Islay whisky in general and Ardbeg in particular, the second best I’ve tasted so far (after the Corryvreckan). The Uigeadail puts the standard 10 Year Old to shame and is still way ahead of the überhyped Rollercoaster. Robust, complex scotch. Though not quite as sweet as I would like with the sherry influence; it struggles with the peat. At 54.2%, this dram is fairly high in alcohol, so exercise caution; I usually pour myself quite a small serving. It's extremely warming. Sip it slowly. Ardbeg is peated, but the rough Listerine flavors are not quite as intense as, say, the Laphroaig Quarter Cask; instead there is a long and complex smokiness going on. There is some vanilla sweetness. It is not as malty-smelling as the Laphroaig -- I'm not reminded of a vanilla sandwich cookie, which is one of the aromas I smell in Laphroaig Quarter Cask. There is a seashore saltiness -- I'm reminded of saltine crackers, actually. There is citrus -- in the case of the oogie, it isn't orange, but lime. On the tongue, the texture is enormously silky and smooth, almost gelatinous. It is not as sweet as one might expect with the sherry cask aging -- I'm reminded of quinine in tonic water -- it somehow makes me think of a gin and tonic. That must be some aromatic compound in there that is reminiscent of juniper. The finish is very long and there are some meaty notes -- Jim Murray is very accurate when he says it is ""like standing downwind of the barbecue while steaks are char-grilled on the beach."" I'm also strongly reminded of a smoked kippers, packed in oil, on caraway seed crackers seasoned with a little black pepper. There are just so many notes here -- a licorice, butter. There are hsome things a little less savory, like lighter fluid, pine solvent, charcoal, and a used ashtray. One writer noted that it is a bit like licking someone's sweaty skin, and I think that's accurate; the flavors are a bit erotic, actually. The smokiness is not a simple thing, but hides all kinds of complexity -- burning sea grass, driftwood, and pine needles. That extremely smooth texture, and light but not cloying sweetness, ensure that you will come back for another sip. With a little water, the citrus aromas come down a bit, and it's more prominently tobacco smoke and iodine. On the tongue, it's a little sweeter and more conventional, although it doesn't seem to lose any complexity -- all those sea flavors are still there on the finish. I get a new, definite note of hot, candied ginger. The finish does become slightly less pleasant when it is wet, though -- we're left with a little more of the pine solvent flavors at the end. It is better straight up. It is certainly one of the best whiskies I've ever tasted, a true benchmark in complexity, and a step up from the very fine Ardbeg 10. I highly recommend it for anyone who has tasted at least one Islay and wants to try another one. I just may have to try all the different expressions of Ardbeg now -- it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it! Colour is pale burnished gold. Nose is completely muted, a little soapy. First taste is smoke, unbelievably subtle and continues to increase as it rests in the mouth. With a drop of water it shows more peat on the nose and the smokey flavour becomes more obvious. The nose is a combination of smokey sweetness and old leather. In the mouth it is smooth and oily, peaty with a touch of smoke. The finish is long, sweet and slightly dry with peppery overtones. One of my favorite Islays. Bottled in 2009. This is reviewed at about 48 % ABV Some tearing on the glass and it is quite oily. Nose: Leather, charcoal and some peat. The alcohol is a bit sticky on the nose and it is difficult to sense any details. With more water the leather becomes the only smell and the alcohol is more protruding. This is not as complex as I expected. Palate: A lot of leather and charcoal. I find a tiny bit of iodine but it isn't taking over. But there is also something a little bit bitter in the back that is not flattering. The alcohol numbs the toung a bit. It is less oily on the palate than the appearence in the glass. With more water the taste of charcoal is dominating the peat disappears and only a little bit of leather is left. It starts to taste a bit of alcohol but the bitterness is gone. Aftertaste: Long and lingering. At first there are heavy charcoal and some charcoal smoke. Develops to peat and leather. More water makes the charcoal smoke come out more but it is flatter than with the higher alcohol level. Balance: The somewhat bitter taste, although it is only peripheral, is a disappointment but other than that there is not any tastes that sticks out. The leather and charcoal is what marks this whisky. On the other hand this is not as complex as I expect from a high profile Ardbeg. I also tried this at my local favorite pub and that one was much more complex and much better than my bottle. I remember clear tones of licorice that is not present here. This is not a bad dram but this bottling can not be what Jim Murray gave the Whisky of the year award. Christmas in a glass. Here's my two bob on the matter. I'll keep this to the point; I get marzipan and figs on the nose with a bit of sweet rubber, like a new Wellington boot.  This whisky is quite an assault on the senses. Sea salt, smoke, aniseed, cured meats with hints of dusty wood, flaked fish food and mint Matchmakers. Oily and rich of body. Its fairly arresting to take in at first but the finish is very smooth for the ABV. Not sure if this is the coolest thing to say but I MUCH prefer this without water. Connosr The smell of this whiskey can waft across half a room. Smoky, peaty, but not heavy - almost refreshing with a hint of sweet citrus and a smidge of caramel. Very strong and smooth - very engaging. The taste is initially smooth and smoky and then hits you with a hot explosion of peat, but the explosion also comes with that hint of citrus and caramel which keeps it all balanced and not too heavy. Makes the mouth water and leaves your lips and tongue tingling. You don't get used to it either - you almost forget in between sips how powerful and fantastic this is!  The finish is long and initially hot (from the flavour explosion), but stays warm for a long time. Still a lot of smoke and peat, but the sweetness is stronger. Much heavier and warmer than the nose and the taste, probably due to the lack of citrus). The heavier finish keeps you from sipping this down too quickly - it keeps you savouring it for longer. The perfect long warm savoury finish to a truly exceptional malt. I initially bought this because I loved the 10 year old, and a mate of mine said he had heard great things about it. It was the first whisky I bought for more than AU$100, so I was a bit nervous. I was floored. At the time this was the best value whisky I had ever tasted, and it was the most expensive (it's still up there with only the Highland Park and the Glenmorangie Astar beating it in the value for money stakes - and even then, only just). Money aside this is out and out my favourite whisky. Powerful, civilised, smooth and superbly balanced. It is like the perfect mix of the civilised Ardbegs, Caol Ilas and Bowmores, and the more elemental Laphroaigs and Lagavulins. If you are into Islay malts, then this is an absolute must. Probably the best Ardbeg, at being an Ardbeg! The taste hits you like a punch in the face with lots of complexity and then slides away almost as fast, leaving you wanting more... Nose: rum-soaked fruit; oranges; faint smoke and alcohol Body: medium Palate: light smoke; raisins/dried fruit; notes of Sherry from the cask; lots of rich complexity Finish: very pleasant and long-lasting I picked up this bottle mainly out of peer pressure. My peat head buddies and twitter friends love it. Every blog I read has nothing but good things to say so hey, I picked up a bottle. Initial whiff - Huntington Beach circa 1981, low tide, me on a boogie board falling face forward in a pile of rotting seaweed. This was not a fun memory. 2nd whiff, same thing with a little sweetness. Last whiff, my sister's suede jacket after a Bon Jovi concent, 1988 with a 7-11 big gulp slushy sweetness. On the mouth -- sweet smoke, iodine, salt, cigarette butts and raisins. Smooth for the ABV Finish, nice, long, smokey and sweet. This is not an every day dram for me. Have to be in the mood. Like the A'bdunah, I think this is one to drink when pissed off. I will say, this has to be one of the most complex drops I've ever sniffed/tested. In the right mood, this is a 10 star dram for me. Tonight, it's an 8 star. i love ardbegs. enjoy the enormous peat. this one is still the best i've had. peat,smoke,leather all combined with sweet smoke. like a smoked desert. but still go that punch. best ardbeg yet. The nose on Uigeadail is smoky, peaty, and briny with hints of leather and honey. All put together, it smells like a well-worn shoe (perhaps a shoe that you wear while you barbeque on a beach by the North Sea). This a bold whisky, firm and almost chewy. There is a sweetness I have never tasted before. I can taste the usual tar, smoke and licorice, but they are balanced and dance on the tongue (although with a heavy step, like a reel or polka rather than a waltz). The finish seems to go on forever. Indeed, I can still taste it the next day."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,46,Ardbeg 10 Year OldOB,"My first Connosr review was an Ardbeg 10 over a year ago now - how time flies!  I've made it no secret I'm a big Ardbeg fan and make it a norm to have at least one bottle of the ten a year.  So how is this one holding up then? Review is from a double pour, neat but sat for ten minutes or so.  Bottle has been open a few weeks with about a third gone. Nose - Classic Ardbeg  . . . which is, for me, TCP, some brine, smoke, chocolate lime sweets and quite a creamy vanilla malt note with this bottle.  More rounded and less of a peaty punch than other bottles (but I am being overly pedantic; through over familiarity, perhaps?).  Still good though, and clean. Taste - Lime sour at first then it develops into creamy vanilla with some distinct barley notes (which is unusual).  A little thin on the mouthfeel it has to be said as well.  Oh and liquorice(y) peat, of course. Finish - Medium-long.  There's a lingering of the lime sourness, peat tang and the familiar bellowing upsurge of smoke is, well, kind of there, but it's also a little less prominent than other bottles I've had.  More of a waft than a bellow.  Some pleasantly bitter tannins. This is still clearly a bottle of Ardbeg 10 but it's definitely a little different than other bottles I've had.  It's as if the neat pour gives what other bottles did after I'd added water; which, by the way, does not help this at all - it loses any peat 'hit' and becomes too watery.    This is better, for me, after a non peaty whisky as it emphasises the kind of notes that I'm after here.  It's still very good but perhaps not quite stellar or going supernova. A classic by all accounts, the Ardbeg 10 is a dram no whisky nut can dare miss.  At £40 in the UK, consistent quality and deep complexity come at a price that won’t break the bank. This particular bottle had been open around a week. And i would like to pay particular attention to the beautiful light gold colouration of the whisky itself once poured into the glass. No caramel colourings here !  Nose- 
First comes a gentle waft of smoke with sweet notes of caramelising sap. Caramel and smoked ham develop as the whisky opens up (just a few minutes in the glass) followed swiftly with the remnants of what can only be the faint remembrance of fresh sea air. Is it mint I detect in the background? I can’t quite tell. But a wonderful nose with deeper vegetal notes that are hard to grasp. Palate-
Smokey sweet. Smoked ham and raisins? Who knew they could make such a grand dance on the tongue. Mint follows just as it did on the nose, accompanied by just a touch of sea salt and a sprinkling of crushed almonds. Finish-
Medium finish with both the sweet and the smoke of the palate fading away together. The smoke dissipates faster at first. But suddenly the sweetness is gone and I’m left with warm smoke which seems to cling to my tongue and the inside of my mouth.  Conclusion -
A wonderfully complex whisky which punches way above both its respective age and price brackets. Peated whiskys are not usually something i would recommend to everyone... but I honestly believe this dram has a little something for everyone. This is an abbreviated of a blog entry I will post tonight or tomorrow According to their promotional materials, Ardbeg is as close to perfection as makes no difference. That's a bold claim. It's also similar to claims made by pretty much every scotch whisky distillery. I've often compared Ardbeg to Clubber Lang and Lagavulin to Rocky Balboa. This is obviously my completely subjective opinion, but if any scotch is going to knock Lagavulin out and claim the coveted ""Joe's favourite scotch"" title, it would likely be Ardbeg. But I also find Ardbeg to remind me of the movie ""The Big Lebowski"". Like the Coen Brothers' cult classic, there's a lot more going on than it would appear at first glance (or first sip, as it were). Tasting Notes Adding water to Ardbeg Ten thrusts the iodine/seaweed and brine notes forward on the nose. It's like walking on a beach and smelling the remnants of a campfire. Delightful. The sweet malt notes and the pear flavours are also more apparent with some water added. Drinking Ardbeg is a gratifying experience with or without water.  There's a lot more going on than smoke and peat. Pouring a dram and taking that first sniff, you'd be forgiven for thinking peat and smoke was the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But Ardbeg is not as it seems. It's bold and complex, yet not without subtlety. Much like the eponymous character in ""The Big Lebowski"" was not the self-made man he claimed to be, Ardbeg is not what it appears to be. It's much more. Just to be clear from the offset - I can't pretend to not have a deep, almost scared, affinity with this whisky so I will try extra hard to be objective and provide clarity of my experience. This was the first ever alcoholic drink that made me grin ear to ear after a sip (well my 2nd sip to be precise - the first being one of confusion, intrigue and a general sense of 'wtf' have I just bought here?!)  It even led to what I believe can be called 'peat flashbacks' the next day out playing golf in the midst of winter.  A very welcome intrusion it must be said. Onto the liquor:   On the nose it's an instant hit of coastal peat.  Minerality comes through with sea shells, oysters, TCP, drift wood beach bonfires and slight oily smoked fish notes.  There's also a citrus fruitiness and an ever so light touch of damp, musty dried fruit that I'm noticing more this time around.  Chocolate lime sweets.  Wonderful. Taste wise; those chocolate limes really come out for me here.  Oily but not overly thick mouth feel that develops into a beautifully sweet fennel, licorice note.  Sweet arrival but becomes more sour.  Reminds me of tequila.  I find I have this neat or if the mood takes me with a few drops of water.  Less peaty with water and more citrus sweetness comes out.   Perhaps more rounded as well? Finish is long and I find as the bottle goes down more smoke comes out here, to the point where I can pretend I'm a dragon breathing fire after a sip.  Slight tannins but very pleasantly so.  A sour note is there. This whisky takes me back to holidays on the west coast of Scotland as a kid -but you could be anywhere on the west coast of Britain and get the same sensations, imo.   It's so well made and I would like to say an available and affordable (mostly) craft whisky but the prices here have gone up a lot in the last couple of years alone.  Still, not bad value at all and a must have for any whisky fan to have at least tried. Ardbeg Ten... well, that hardly needs any kind of introduction, of course. It is a standard whisky, but of such good reputation that it belongs in each and every whisky cabinet. I have tried several batches and they are all - in my opinion - very close. So hat's off to the master blender, in casu Dr Bill Lumsden. Today I will try a Ten that was bottled on 17th November 2015.
Classic Ardbeg nose with some lime, apples and vanilla that are soon joined by the typical maritime elements such as brine, peat smoke and something that reminds me of gasoline. Some burnt wood and even some smoked ham in the background make this nose a joy for the lovers of this type of Ileach.
The peat rears its head from the very first sip. And while this Ardbeg remains sweet and creamy it's that salty edge and those notes of peat that give this it's complexity. Lots of mineral elements as well. It's like having gravel in your mouth, so to speak. I quite like this.
That mineral side is extra powerful in the long and warm finish.
Yes, Ardbeg Ten remains a top dram. Bull's eye every time. Thanks for the sample, Pat! Nice grassy nose. On the palate it is very Smokey, followed by a grassy, hay flavor. Finish is dry and grassy. Light to medium body, with a nice kick. This is a good go-to peated dram.  The last digit of the reviewed bottle's bottle code is unclear, but it is assumed to be 2015, because the bottle was purchased in May 2016. The bottle has been open for 10 weeks and is 85% full Colour: very pale, like pinot grigio Nose; petrol, bitter peat, light smoke, lemon, but not too much, light brine. I like this a lot better than when the bottle was first opened. Water added softened the nose, but did not add anything but dilution. I had bought my neighbour this bottle and a bottle of Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength Batch # 007 for a dinner party with 8 of his friends from Beijing. The Laphroaig was very popular at dinner; this was not. After dinner my neighbour gave me this bottle to take home. Score: 22.5/25 Taste: sharp-edged acrid bitter and sour peat with just a little sweet peat added; more lemon citrus than the nose, still tolerable, but near the limit of being too much. Faint hint of vanilla. Water added softened the palate and left citrus as the noticeable accompaniment to bitter and sour peat. There is no improvement with water. Score: 20.5/25 Finish: long, bitter and sour, with no balance. The finish is not a highlight. Water added increases the perception of the sour component, and offers no improvement. Score: 19/25 Balance: very good on the nose; fair to good thereafter. Score: 18.5/25 Total Sequential Score: 80.5 points Strength: quite strong in all phases of the tasting. Score: 23/25 points Quality: good to very good flavours throughout. Score: 21/25 Variety: good variety of flavours. Score: 21/25 Harmony: too much sour and too little sweetness in the mouth. Score: 18/25 Total Non-Sequential Score: 83 points Comment: despite a very good nose, this batch of Ardbeg Ten goes too sour in the mouth with inadequate sweet balance and is one of the lesser batches I have tasted. If this one was blended using the nose alone, I can understand why. It does have a great nose  To be honest, I never really enjoyed big peat in my dram. I am more of a fan of Speyside type flavors. BUT...this Ardbeg 10YO really makes me reconsider my stance on Islay Whisky. NOSE: burned wood, smoked bacon, tar with lovely undertones of malty sweetness and fruitiness. A bit of water brings out the fruitiness from underneath the blanket of peat and smoke along with herbal aromas of mint.Vanilla, hints of citrus.  TASTE: complex, moderately sweet. Oily, creamy mouthfeel with gentle peat accompanying the whole experience in a very harmonious way. Mineral. The mineral nature of this dram reminds me of San Pellegrino mineral water. At the very end of its development, the taste reminds me a lot tarragon. Really, really delicious.  FINISH: warming, mineral again, ash and peat which just won't leave you alone.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: Wow. I've immensely enjoyed the complexity and the contrast between the creaminess and fruitiness and the big and bold bonfire-ishness of Ardbeg 10YO along with those delicate herbal notes.. I'm definitely trying Ardbeg Uigeadail! I re-read a review I posted in 2013 wherein I gave this fine whisky a low score. I was new to Islays. As is nearly always the case, persistence paid off and now I am an almost exclusive Islay drinker and there is just no going back. Ardbeg 10 year is a wonderful flavor explosion. Nose: Telltale Ardbeg smoked peat; old motor oil; vanilla bean; fresh thistle sap; road tar; fried green tomatoes; BBQ potato chips. Taste: A smoky affair: good quality Ardbeg smoked peat; burning Oregon oak in a wood stove with the dried moss igniting and sizzling through the open stove door. Starts off kinda Caol Ila with hints of a beach bonfire, and then quickly veers off into a distinctly Ardbegian sense landscape that is darker and more transhumanistically industrial.  Finish: More of the same with the smoke lingering longest in a way that is a faint echo of Corry. Smoke, smoke, smoke. This has changed over the past few weeks. It used to finish with a touch more of that signature peatiness.  Well, I'd have to say that this is the best 10 Year I've had from Ardbeg in some time. I was not a fan of the 2014 bottlings. They were a bit ""hinky"" as they say in Chicagoland.  This one has less of the sea in it than Uigeadail but it is damned good. In a way, it faintly reminds me of Solstice 2nd Ed. on the tail end of the finish.  I would not add any water to this, but it does improve with time in the glass, as one would expect. This 2015 bottling of the 10 is far more peaty than last year's, and ""That's just the way I likes it!"" Bring on the peat, is what I say. Odds bodkins. You done good, Ardbeg. For a ten, you done gone and did it real proper-like. I'm going back for one or two more o' these. Word to the wise: aerate or wait. If you find this bottling code, don't expect it to be this good right outa the gates. My bottle took a couple of months to approach where it is now in terms of my rating. When I first opened it, I was not all that impressed. And, yes, I do rate my whisky with price in mind. So if this bottle had cost the same as Uigeadail, then I would have rated it lower, but considering it cost me just under fifty bucks, its score went up a notch or two. This green bottle of Ardbeg Ten certainly towers like a giant over last year's releases. Of course, nothing compares to the early 2000's 10er's with their significantly older broth helping to light up the corners. So let's not try to compare anything these days to those good ole days that are long gone now. Bottling Code: 25/03/2015 Bottle just opened, so it hasn't aired out or oxygenated much.  Here are my initial impressions: It is very ashy indeed. On the nose, quite young with hints of mescal. Reminds me of PC5, but not in as sophisticated a way. A bit one dimensional.  The palate is also very young. I am reminded of tequila a bit. With quite a bit of ash and a little of the Ardbeg peat I crave. My guess is that this peat ratio will improve with oxygenation, but I can't be certain yet.  The finish goes up to a sweeter note, but not to any remarkable extent. I think that Serge and Ralfy were a bit overly optimistic about this year's Ardbeg 10.  It has NO older spirit in it. None in the least. If I were blindfolded, I would identify it as YOUNGER than 10 years. Am I disappointed in my purchase? Yes, even given the price.  I long for older Ardbegs. That is simply the way it is. I offer no apologetics. Take it as you will. One man's opinion.  NOSE: hint of vanilla, peat, burnt wood, slight citrus zest, the aroma of the ground after a heavy rain  TASTE: initially sweet, oily, creamy, with hints of citrus (tangerine), gentle peat, bonfire smoke; cardboard then also some sea salt. Very well rounded and balanced.  FINISH: mineral notes, very remote iodine.  Overall impression: a very interesting Islay experience. The taste in particular is very complex and really enjoyable. However, I wouldn't say that it's in the top 10 for me. Nose - lots of peat and tar also petrol. After a few minutes smoked meat and pear notes. Palate is rich, smoky and meaty, very pleasant. Extremely long finish. Considering its young age, this whisky offers incredible balance. Great value for reasonable price. Great value for reasonable price. I bought this bottle to explore the other Islay offerings and I was very impressed. The peat is quite heavy which, in the case of Laphroaig was a turn off, but here it is complimented with a range of other notes. nose: wispy/controlled smoke especially on the edges, big peat, almonds, briny sea air, airy sweetness, a really nice additional note grassy? mouth: brine shifting to plain salt in the middle of the tongue, smoke, slight herbalness of a high quality lozenge, peat, the light sweetness from the nose. body: light burn dies off in the finish, light mouth coat finish: long, oak, drying in the back, salty, very very good long lingering salt Hold this one in your mouth and appreciate the development. Guaranteed 10 years old seems an odd term to use for a minimum age statement, but this distillery did stand idle for a few years in the 1990’s before Glenmorangie came to the rescue which probably explains it. I first encountered this malt shortly after it’s revival in an Oddbins in Nottinghill, London. I should also have invested in the 17 year old, but alas I was a poor student back then and had other priorities so I never had the pleasure of that famous dram. The mysterious pale, almost colourless liquor, was a shock to my younger self (it didn’t look like whisky as I knew it) but I soon got over it.  There may be a tad more colour to the dram these days, but not much. The aroma is clean and smoky, with a phenolic peat smoke edge, along with some sweeter notes of vanilla and some herby heather like hints. The flavours are awesome and given time to develop reward the drinker with seemingly endless subtle complexities. Not an easy ride though as there almost as many bitter piquant notes as there are sweet mellow ones, smoke, phenolic peat, bitter coffee on one side and sandlewood, chocolate, vanillas and malt on the other and a saltyness marries the twain. The sweeter flavours dominate the long satisfying finish with more malt contribution rising in favour of the peat smoke.  This is my favourite entry Level bottle. The heavy peat and fresh citrus hits all the right spots. Nose: Very thick, clean and aromatic. Deep campfire smoke, wood, brine, peat, tar and petroleum. On the sweeter side some licourice, lemon, sweet bacon. Just delightful. Palate: Oily mouth-feel. Starts a bit funky, with lemon juice. Sweet ash, burnt toast, salty and smoky. Not as balanced as the nose. Finish: Long, meat, malt, warming earthy peat and chocolate. Soapy licorice, salt. The funky lemon-peat game was weird at first, but definitely a grower. As the 50ml finished, I was desperately in love. The cleanliness and lots of other notes remind me of Caol Ila, but with considerably more peat. It is kind of paradoxical: not complex but rich - simple but satisfying. Found notes on the Old Ardbeg 10, last drams, tucked in a drawer. Nose: Licorice, and oily, tarry Sherry sweets. Freshly varnished fence posts. Stewed apples and lemon peel. Sea salt. So much goin on, people are afraid of it because they don't know what to think.  Body: fizzy cola, cough medicine, winter spices, then salt and red wine, but fruity like merlot. Raisins. Peanuts. Hint of toast. Finish: licorice again, rounding it all off. Awesome dram - so much, so balanced for a 10 year old. After having enjoyed a glass of this with a friend several months ago, I had an opportunity to purchase a 1 liter bottle in duty-free on my last flight. I must say I have been initially disappointed; as this lot seems to be exceedingly strong in nose and taste with a ""burning rubber"" chemically sensation. At first I contemplated throwing it out or relegating it to the back of the cupboard; but I have recently re-sampled adding water (and I little more than I might normally use) and I now find it beginning to grow on me. Still BIG smoke and huge attitude, but definitely complex... I won't go on about palate and finish at this time - I'm still sorting it out!! I'm in the midst of building my own blog right now. In doing so, I'm using a lot of old reviews. Going back, I've realized how much my tastes and opinions have changed over the past two years of reviewing. Some of my old reviews are, umm, embarrassing. But since we can't change the old ones here, I think a few re-reviews will be coming down the pipes. Here's a much needed update on the Ten. This is my fourth bottle of the Ten. I didn't like my first bottle much, but times have changed. I love it now, and it’s one of a handful of whiskies that you’ll always find in my cabinet. One of the best value-for-money offerings from Islay these days. Nose: Lemon cough drops, pears, brine, sea air, and big, smoky peat. The peat is crisp, clean, and has an industrial tinge to it. Oak isn’t obvious, but it’s in there. Palate: Light bodied, with a paced arrival. A strong mineral flavour accompanies the industrial peat. Lemon cough drops, tarmac, and menthol.  Finish: It gets sweeter as honey makes an appearance. We move on to camphor, seawater, menthol, minerals, earth, and peat. Faint hints of chocolate, menthol, pine, and metal linger. Medium-long. It’s time to revise that first impression, this is damn good. Crisp, clean, industrial-style peat is what Ardbeg does best. If you want casual peat fix, I’d take this over most entry-level Islay offerings. Also, this is a good year-round whisky. Big, bold flavours will warm your bones in winter, and a light body with clean flavours will suit you just fine in summer. Big, balanced, and satisfying. Easily a cabinet mainstay. My first taste of an Ardbeg, one of the peatiest Islay malts. ­Nose – Peat smoke, tar and creosote, fresh pears and pear drops, then a hint of menthol and lots of creamy, buttery vanilla icing and some sharp, sweet lemon citrus. With water a hint of sea salt and fresh, damp pine forest. ­ Palate – Initial attack of peat, bonfire smoke and lots of sweet coal tar along with a vegetal earthiness. Then light but intense fruity flavours of fresh pear, apple juice, sharp citrus lemon, creamy milk in the background, with hints of pepper and allspice, with the a big hit of leafy, herbal peat returning at the back of the mouth with some salt. Oily mouth-feel. ­ Finish – Mellow, vegetal peat smoke and sweet tar, and a touch of saltiness. Tobacco, warming spices, black coffee, along with dry fennel and liquorice at the end, forming a long, slightly bitter finish. Different from other peaty malts I've tried, a complex combination of light fruity flavours and heavy peaty, tarry smoke. Lovely complex flavours throughout nose, palate and finish and certainly recommendable.  So on my last trip up to visit (and taste) with @Victor I took the opportunity to pick up (and open) a new batch of Ardbeg (batch L13 241). I opened it at his place and we both tasted it. I thought, “this is a pretty good Ardbeg TEN.” The reaction of @Victor was that it was an inferior batch. He then let me try his open bottle . . . this batch . . . and BAM my Ardbeg experience was brought back into perspective. This L10 152 is a great batch, and I am very grateful that @Victor gave me a sample to do this review. Here is my impression after one taste at his place and a 2oz sample bottle. I can only imagine what this must have been like when it was freshly opened . . . Nose: Very big on the nose! Tons of peat, far more ash, tar, fresh asphalt, and motor oil then the L9. This also has tons of fresh cut grass; it almost stings the nose. This can’t be 46% . . . it has so much power! (and I know it has been open for a while!) There is a bit of lemon there adding some brightness, but it is only noticeable when you really hunt for it. Lemon is not a note I immediately go to with this nose. This has a surprising amount of “midrange” tone to the nose. It hits you right were a good Brora would; what I call the “mustard tone” region. This has a wonderful one, two punch. First it hits you with a low deep peat tone, and then K-POW in the face with tons of midrange and high tones. I like it. It definitely is in competition with the L11 194 for best nose of the night. Now it is getting into some lime and lemon tones (like lime cream). This is easily the biggest nose of the night, and perhaps the biggest Ardbeg TEN nose I have encountered.  Taste: This is sweet, but not as sweet as several of the other batches. Very thick ex-bourbon influence of vanilla, wood, but still plenty of peat. There is a hint of that charcoal wood.  Finish: Big peat attack with an abundance of that liquorish note. The liquorish is sweeter then the L13 241, but without being as big and dominant. That said the liquorish is bigger than the L11 194. Now, lots of hay, barley, and grassy notes appear to go with the peat and iodine. Very much in that “cut grass” category compared to other Ardbeg batches. I like it. Complexity, Balance: Second most complex and second most balanced batch of the night. It is the biggest (which I like). It really is that mid-range cut grass that really causes this one to stand out. It isn’t quite as complex on the finish as the L13 241, but I love the power. Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY e-150a in these bottles.  Conclusion: I would LOVE to own a few bottles of this. I swear, @Victor has some fantastic batches of Ardbeg at hand. When you regularly encounter amazing batches of Ardbeg it is easy to see why people go gaga for this distillery. And then there are bad batches. If your first bottle is one of these you will probably be very disappointed in Ardbeg and question all the hype. My answer – check your special secret batch code!! Here good people is a fantastic example of Ardbeg TEN from the newly produced spirit. I doubt there are any old casks in this vatting . . . and it is still amazing. It goes to show the importance of cask selection. So this is the most recent batch of Ardbeg TEN that I have picked up. When I opened it with @Victor in March my very first impression was, “this is a good batch.” Then I tried @Victor’s batch from L10 which blew this one away in power and depth. Since that experience I have slowly drained this bottle . . . and I examined it against a number of other whiskies at different times (3 different Corry’s, Uigeadails, Laphroaig’s, and other peaty beasts). Finally, I put it up against 4 other batches of Ardbeg TEN. I have scored it on 4 occasions: 91, 92, 90, and 91. So I have to come down on the side of saying that this is a very good batch. It doesn't blow your socks off . . . but it is good. Nose: Creamiest batch of the night. It has some low tones, and it has some high tones. The peat is down low, coal in the middle with the lemon up high. It is like a peat coal cake (with some dark cacao) with a lemon frosting. The peat is the base, then the coal, and finally the lemon rests on top. There is also some wood right in the middle with the coal. It doesn’t have quite the low or the high tones of the L11, but it does have some interesting mild oil, dirt, mineral, and peat notes. This isn’t as dark or deep as the L11 or the L10, but this does have some interesting pine needles, and “green” smells happening. Probably the smoothest nose of the batches tonight. This is far from a complex Ardbeg nose, but this is spot on for a standard Ardbeg 10yo in my book. Taste: Very sweet compared to the L9. But in actually this is medium sweet. Loads of peat, citrus, and wood. Maybe some pine cones? Light peat, some salt, wood, barley . . . and something that reminds me of a light Speysider (a Glen-something). A little bit of smoke but not mind blowing. Finish: Big peat blast (very liquorishy), now a low rumble that is chest warming. This is all about peat, and wood fire. Tons of that wood, peat coal, and liquorish. Far bigger, darker with more minerality than the L9 or the L11. This has that diesel oil and coal thing going on. This might have the biggest finish of the night if not for that L10. Definitely the woodiest finish of the night . . . but in a good way. Complexity, Balance: Lots going on here. Not as big as the L10 or as complex as the L11, but still very interesting and enjoyable for a 10 year old.  Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY color in these bottles. Average color for a TEN.  Conclusion: This isn’t as big and powerful as the L10 152. Nor is it as dark and complex as the L11 194. However, it has something to it that is really hard to place. Much like the standard Laphroaig 10yo this batch can drink bigger then it actually is. I enjoy it quite a bit. And so, while the score in only a point or two below other batches I enjoy far more . . . this is still one I am tempted to buy more of even thought I am not sure why. I reach for it over other whiskies that I score much higher. For that reason I consistently score it in the low 90’s. But in all honesty I would expect most people to score this batch in the high 80’s.  This is a bottle I opened while I was living in Seattle. That means I bought it and opened it sometime in 2009 (I really can’t remember any more than that). I have a picture of it being ¼ full and open in December of 2009 along with several other Ardbeg bottles (Uigeadail, Supernova, Almost There, and the Beist). I re-bottled it before I left in 2010 (so the bottle is long gone along with its precious code). Then I re-bottled it into an even smaller bottle on the 1st of December 2012. On a recent night I tasted against 4 other Ardbeg TEN batches (L10 152, L11 194, L13 003, and L13 241). Nose: Peat, peat, and a hint of lemon. Some ash, some coal, a bit of diesel oil, and then more peat hinted with lemon. Smoke almost to the point of bitterness like a fire pit the morning after a fire . . . almost. There is more chlorine, and a higher tone than the L11 194. This is probably the ashiest nose of the night. Not that deep or complex. It could easily have been all the time it had to oxidize.  Taste: Less sweet then the L13 241. Then it starts moving in the non-sweet direction in a hurry. Not bitter, but certainly on the verge. There is plenty of wood, sawdust, pencil shavings, and peat followed by a bit of ash and smoke as well. This batch is certainly the “non-sweet” side of Ardbeg. Finish: A bit of sweetness (natural raw cane sugar) that quickly dies away . . . now the classic Ardbeg intake of breath . . . here comes the wave of peat, iodine, and salt . . . so slow and long. This is more of a saline solution then the sharp sea spray that Ardbeg usually has. Everything is a bit mellow here (again, oxidization?) Complexity, Balance: Not the most complex on the nose, but very well balanced on the taste and finish . . . almost too balanced for me. I like my Ardbeg with a bit more bite than this. But then, who knows how long I had it opened and oxidizing? Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY color in these bottles. This particular batch is average color; almost the exact color as the L13 241!  Conclusion: This bottle might go back all the way back to 2008 when I opened a bottle of the Beist and Almost There on my birthday (I drank WAY slower in those days). What I can remember is never being impressed with this bottle. It was just standard issue. And now all these years later it is still just an average Ardbeg TEN at best. Older versions are not always better.  Sweet smoky lemons Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. The 10-year old expression was introduced in 2000 and has been part of Ardbeg’s core range ever since. Here is the label code, especially for Nock: L14 014 07:01 6ML. The nose is crisp, fresh, salty and lightly smoky. There are plenty of vanilla flavours, together with milky cereal sweetness, brine and hints of lemon. The palate is medium-bodied and just a tad peppery. Lemon, vanilla and salt are at the forefront, until a wave of soft smoke rolls over the tongue. Towards the end distinctly sweet elements such as liquorice and dried fruits emerge. The finish is of medium length, smoky and salty. Smokiness and sweetness are well balanced, with cereal flavours and hints of liquorice making a final appearance. I am a big fan of Ardbeg and I do like almost all expressions, be it the assertive Corryvreckan, the lush Uigeadail, the seductive Airigh Nam Beist – you name it. However, the 10-year old expression lacks the complexity that all of the above-mentioned come with. Is it fresh and fruity? Yes. Is it nicely smoky? Yes. But that is about it. Somehow I would have expected a little bit more depth and character. Ardbeg had been very close to being buried next to Port Ellen and a few other legendary distilleries. The distillery had been mothballed twice in the eighties and nineties. The real salvation came from Glenmorangie (now LVHM). Since the stills were reheated in 1997, Ardbeg's reputation soared like an eagle. Now fans nearly come to blows when they launch special or limited editions.  The core range is rather limited. The Ardbeg Ten is accompanied by two NAS expressions: Uigeagail and Corryvreckan. And that's about it. Every year on May 31th, Ardbeg Day, they launch a new limited edition. And since 2014 is all about the World Cup in Brazil it was named Auriverdes. Tasting Notes Colour: Ardbeg Ten clearly matures exclusively in ex-bourbon casks. It is a light yellow whisky with a sticky texture. The tears slide gracefully down the glass. Nose: Typical Ardbeg peat smoke (makes sense right?) pairs nicely with rubber and used bicycle tires. A sea breeze over the pier combined with sweet vanilla flavours and citrus zest. Further up are associations of tar, blown matches and chlorine. Water releases sweet aromas. Vanilla, black pudding with raisins and smoked bacon with a thin coat of maple syrup. Everything is garnished with some lemon marmalade. Taste: The tongue undergoes a pleasant symbiosis of sweet and salt. Juicy pears with coarse sea salt, freshly picked mint, rosemary and vanilla. Towards the end the smoky and citric flavours return. Adding water to this Ardbeg means adding a little more richness: black pepper, roasted milk bread and grounded coffee. Finish: The black pepper continues through the finish with some star anise. A relatively long finish. Conclusion This was my very first peated whisky nearly two years ago. Saying I wasn't convinced was an understatement at the time. Right now it’ll be more something like “Bring it on !”. These kind of flavour bombs are the reason a (wo)man starts drinking whisky. Ardbeg Ten can be found everywhere. Every supermarket with a decent range or nameworthy liquor store, has it in store. The price has, influenced by demand and duties, risen towards the € 50 mark.

This is a great single malt hall marked with its peat character and it's deep savory richness. Nose: tinge of salt cured meat, savory peat, dirt, citric acid, over ripe almost decaying onion. Caramelized onion. Taste: rich robust smoke as from a barbecue. An onion sweatiness with an ex bourbon chatted sweetness. It's an easy to I obtain classic. Take your time with it and you will receive dividends. I will seek to replace my bottle.  Well... having found this for £37 (44€) in the UK this weekend I decided to go for it. I'm not an advanced drammer by any stretch of the imagination, but being a great fan of HP and Lagavulin I thought I'd see what a heavier peated scotch tasted like. Nose - love it... maritime and oily. Fish? But not quite the silky 'smoked salmon' of the Lagavulin 16... Palate - wow... I get mostly rubber, iodine and dark unsweetened chocolate. Medium to full bodied... I cannot find any of the vanilla or zesty flavours mentioned by many. Finish - moss, iodine & more burnt rubber. I find it hard to get past that rubber for some reason! Makes it hard to really enjoy. For me the finish is far too much about the iodine & burnt rubber than anything else. I just don't get much flavour-complexity out of this. Maybe it will grow on me, but I just don't like it anywhere near as much as the other peated whiskies I've tried, ie. Lag'16 and Laphr 10/15 I will add water with it next time and see what changes... I have to say that this was not my first Islay malt but was my first Ardbeg. I can still remember the nose on this dram. It was a lemony, peaty, vanilla, with an espresso boldness that I can still taste today. From the first nosing this dram had a majesty about it that needed no pre-description. If you love the Islay malts you'll remember the one that got you hooked. This was mine. I could nose this whiskey for hours. The scents of the sea, that fishy/salty smoke, with a peppery-citrus tang and soft vanilla undertone. I cannot think of another Ten year old malt with such depth and diversity. Slainte Mhath!  This is my first review despite 40 years of devotion to my favourite tipple. I started on blends and have matured/graduated from the sweet highlands to the caramel Kirkwall Islands and am now stumbling cheerily through Peaty Islay. I am a huge fan of Laphroaig and Lagavulin. Reviews and thoughts on these will flow later. Ardbeg 10 is my third wonderful discovery and I was a little hesitant after reading mixed reviews but the first breath from the bottle dispelled my fears. I have a hound dog nose and could get a weekend job working with beagles at the airport so I'm told. My descriptors may differ from the more experienced reviewers on this site so here goes. Nose - cool peat smoke like a menthol cigarette. Orange zest crushed and minced with white pepper. Taste - up front I get brined lemon and rock salt. Complexity or at the back is old blackcurrent jam and light ash. Finish - dull over ripe plums and a waft of smoke. Batch L11 011 14.53 6ML I was scared of this single malt and even more scared to write this review until i got a better handling of this beast, Nose: Peat, lemon-lime, dark chocolate, Menthol, black pepper, a hemp like aroma, graphite, smoked salted fish, bacon. Palate:Peat, tangy lemon-lime, black pepper, smoked fish, coffee, bananas, currants. Finish: Smoked Cheddar, smoke, chewy expresso Overall an excellent whisky, i prefer it over laphroaig. Try this and give it a chance and watch as you are amazed by the strength of it. Here’s a little comparison review of an older vs. newer bottle of Ardbeg 10, just to see if any significant changes occurred with this popular dram over a three-year period. I found an older bottle of Ardbeg 10, tucked behind a row of newer bottles, on the shelf at the local store. I recognized the older-style packaging that was discontinued in 2009, so of course I snatched it up. Bottle code is L9 096, which, I believe, is the last batch issued in the U.S. (April 2009, according to the Ardbeg Project website) with the old bottle and packaging. This review will compare that bottle to a 2012 bottling, with a code of L12 071. Maybe there’s not much practical value in comparing two random batches, I’ll admit. And it might prove nothing insofar as the “older=better” debate is concerned. I could have a sensational batch from ’12 and a dud from ’09, after all. So maybe I have no better reason for writing this review than wanting to share my thoughts as I enjoyed these two drams side-by-side. The 2012 bottle is about five months old, down below the halfway mark. Last sampled a couple of months ago, and gassed after doing so. This will be my third dram from the 2009 bottle, opened three days ago. Nose (2012, neat): Stings with earthy peat. A bit of that unpleasant pavement-after-rain smell. Lemons and fresh sea air help balance things. Something sharp and metallic here, and I kind of like the way it kicks you in the nostrils and dares you not to like it. Tames down considerably after a 12-minute sit. Nose (2009, neat): Much, much fresher. No dirty or metallic notes here. The peat and lemons are co-stars here, and a little touch of mint is a new supporting player. No sting, no alcohol, even with the heartiest of whiffs. Palate (2012, neat): Nice and syrupy on arrival, nice oily coating as it sits. Begins rather subtly with vanilla and citrus fruits (or a lime Dreamsicle, if you prefer), followed by a slow-creeping burn of peat and pepper. A fascinating finish comes and goes in waves: just when you think it’s gone, it comes back for yet another encore. Carmel and smoke during the quiet moments, pepper and smoke during the crescendos. Palate (2009, neat): Yes, this is a very different beast. Smooth as butter on silk, even if that smoothness compensates for some lack of balance. (But then, whoever praised Ardbeg 10 for its balance?) More tame and watery in the arrival than the ’12, and the development is much slower, but the same heat and peppers show up eventually. No back-and-forth finish here; it’s steady, long-lasting, but mild—and with much more wood. The wood turns sticky and sappy after about a minute. Even at a rather healthy 49% ABV, I prefer Ardbeg 10 neat. But I also enjoy its changes after a few drops of water. Just a few, please. It’s a lousy swimmer and drowns easily. Nose (2012, with water): A strong vanilla note, absent before. The vanilla almost dominates now, in fact, as the neat aromas become soft whispers. The peat makes a major resurgence after a 10-minute wait. Nose (2009, with water): Same as the 2012, only less so. The vanilla is tamer, the other aromas near-invisible, and the traces of peat are slightly dirtier. Overall, however, there’s a bright freshness to it that’s something of a face-slapper in itself. Palate (2012, with water): Eerily like the neat 2009. Quiet, neutral arrival, followed by some peppery sting. A little more vanilla overall. Some wood, no longer exclusive to the ’09, appears in the finish. Palate (2009, with water): Two or three drops of water really make a difference in this one. A creamy balance of vanilla and peat on the arrival, with a much more interesting burn (peat, pepper, lemons and limes) as it develops. The finish is more clipped, but it’s full of some nice vanilla and oak. Nothing but pure peat at the fadeout. Yum. Hmmm…I guess I didn’t prove much beyond the difference in two each-in-its-own-way tasty batches. And that you should nose and drink both neat, although be sure to have a couple of sips of the ’09 with a little water. And that I probably didn’t mention “peat” in this review as often as I should have. On most nights, I’d give a 90 to both, but I’m in a generous mood tonight. This will be my first review, been drinking whisky for soon a year now. Actually started my spirit journey alltogether about a year ago. My first love was Jack Daniels Old no7, now i think its average, but still good. My taste has gravitated to more heavy stuff, islays, cask strength whiskys and brandys. Nose: Nosed from a brandy balloon. Matchbox, ash, candlewax, dirt, oak, white wine. Palate: Same as nose. Pasta, very sweet-sugary, some vanilla and citrus. Finish: Peatsmoke, wax, licoricy, slight dirt and green apple skin. Coats ure mouth and last long. This whisky sorts of taste like a bourbon highland malt with islay heavy peat, i like the laphroaigs ive tasted better(quarter+10yo) where the style of the malt suits the peat better. Laphroaig is more musty/funky in the overall taste, while Ardbeg TEN have that clean highland taste to it in addition to the peat. Not much complexity, but still a very good whisky if u like that heavy islay peat. Nose: Sweet maritime peat greets your nose. Wood chips and splinters, sea salt, seaweed, and wet rocks dominate the middle of the nose. After you get past the peat smoke you can pick up the citric lemon acid tinges to the whole. Definitely lemon zest mixed with maritime peat. It is an austere peat; not the deep complex peat of Lagavulin nor the muddy and iodine peat of Laphroaig. It makes you thing of old leather chairs, bits of wood by the fireplace, and a smoldering peat fire. This is a coastal boat trip with a peat fired engine. However, there is also a bit of that citrus lemon oil from the peel going on here. Light citrus hovers over the peat bog: lemon zest trimming the bog just like the golden celtic knot trims the dark label and bottle. Truly this smells like the bottle looks . . . love it! And the smoke . . . it undergirds everything here. You don’t even notice it because it is in the background. With water – more peat and lemon. Also there is a bit of chocolate that emerges. It actually took water rather well. I like it quite a bit. No change in score.  Taste: Light gold peat on the tongue. Semi-sweet peat with a notes of vanilla, sea salt, seaweed paper, and a hint of iodine on the back. There is lemon rind mixed with peat and a nice pinch of sea salt on top of a bead of cooked seaweed. Also, a hint of oak with plenty of smoke in the background. The slightly bitter earth balances nicely with the slightly sweet peat. = 5.5 Finish: Big Ardbeg intake of breath along with that searing hot salt water . . . but no big wave. Interesting. Big dollop of peat, moss, dark earth, tree bark, oak, and smoke. There is also plenty of that seaweed paper, spicy red pepper, and some of that lemon rind zing. Lovely and lingering.  Complexity, Balance: Very complex . . . for a 10yo. This does an amazing balance of the peat and the lemon, the maritime and the bonfire. The balance of sweet peat to sour citrus, bitter dark earth to spices; smoke to seaweed is amazing. It delivers what it promises on the nose. Really complex, refined and balanced on the nose. That alone gets it into a top running. It is a study in complexity and balance: it doesn’t seem like a peat bruiser a mouth destroyer, nor is it passive and gentile. It is everything I want in a single malt. The only thing keeping it from perfection in my book is that it lacks those extra crazy elements (like old Ardbegs, and Broras) that cause you to be amazed at its depth. Not quite there . . . but then it is only 10 years old . . . and for a 10yo it is amazing!  Aesthetic experience: Slightly more straw and lighter color then the L13 003. Love this bottle (and this batch). I love the label, the shape, the color, the ABV, the ncf, and the traditional “A.” If only I could find more bottles like this one!  Nose: Peat, lime, cream and vanilla. The vanilla suggests a vatting of very fresh ex-bourbon casks (in this case from Jack Daniels). The citrus is stronger and more astringent then what I consider typical Ardbeg. I would say more on the lime side then the lemon side of things. And there is this soft creaminess to the nose as opposed to the dark bog you can often get. The peat is much more in the background covered up by the citrus and vanilla. Smoke is creeping out around the edges. I know after some time this will get smokier. Sweet vanilla and lime cream with smoke and salted capers. Strong sweetness from the vanilla is almost a high tenor in tone.
Water really dampens the vanilla and brings up the peat smoke. Still plenty strong. Decent standard Ardbeg nose with peat smoke and citrus. Nothing deep, mind blowing, or amazing. Taste: Nice creamy vanilla and lime mixed with peat; now some smoke and capers are coming out. An alder plank smoked trout with caper berries! A little more rounded then I like my Ardbeg TEN. Finish: Nice Ardbeg intake of breath . . . here comes the wave of sea salt and peat. Medium to medium low wave. Not the big Uigeadail, Corry, or Supernova tidal wave I have come to love. A decent finish all things told. Nothing overwhelming; but still Ardbegy. The creamy lime really leaves a mark. Not my favorite “new” Ardbeg tone. Complexity, Balance: Decent balance for the 10yo. Not the most complex by any means, but about what you would expect from a standard 10yo. The problem is I have come to expect WAY more from Ardbeg then this is showing. Aesthetic experience: Very light straw color. I love the label, the shape, the color of the bottle, the ABV, the ncf, and the traditional “A.""  Over the next while, interspersed with other reviews, I'll be revisiting some standard, entry-level single malt expressions that I haven't written on before (but that I've mostly tasted in bars, at parties, etc). Many of you may find this exercise boring but I find it very interesting; it's always good to revisit an old friend (or nemesis) with fresh eyes (or a fresh palate, as the case may be). In this case, we have one of my favourites. Ardbeg 10 Year Old as been part of their stable for a very long time, but the current variant came out in 2008, ten years after Glenmorangie acquired the distillery. In other words, Dr. Bill had full control over this spirit. The colour is an extremely pale yellow, like very weak tea. On the nose there is a liquorice sweetness, with tart green apples, tar, damp campfire, lemon/lime, and lots of briny sea spray. More peaty and robust with a drop of water. The complexity of the sweet/peat combination is astounding, especially in an entry-level expression such as this. I could nose this forever. On the palate, there is more brine but again, it is surprisingly sweet and malty. Pears, bandages, more lemon/lime. Dried grasses in a field. Sardines on saltines. White pepper and a touch of mint. Water brings about a creamier mouthfeel and a bit more peat and spice. Wonderfully delicious. On the finish there are deeper spices, and low waves of rolling peat smoke. This may very well be the greatest of all entry-level single malts, with complexity, vibrancy and excitement. It's too bad it is so expensive - in Ontario this is $100! - but I suppose this is now a luxury product, since being acquired by LVMH. FYI this is a huge Jim Murray favourite, scoring 97 and winning World Whisky of the Year in 2008. Knowing each and every one of you has tried this scotch, I hope I haven't bored you too much! I love Islay malt, my love for them is almost unconditional, than why do I not like this peaty monster? I'm still not sure why and will surely try another dram of the 10 yo in the near future to make sure it wasn't a just a bad batch. But all I can say so far that it was a disappointing experience that just burned in my mouth but little to no flavour to restore the balance. I tried this one at the bar and liked it enough to buy it the next day. I prefer Caol Ila 12 when compared to this one, because it has more flavor. Since I won't be buying this one again, I keep it on hand to spice up any future purchases that wind up being uneventful by adding only a few drops of this Ardbeg 10 (God forbid!!!). Adding any more than a few drops will just obliterate whatever is the main malt, trust me on this. This may be due to the relatively high alcohol contact, but not quite cask strength. I would imagine that a couple of drops of this added to Glenlivet 12 may really work well. After the distillery being mothballed in 1983, this whisky here really shows what a long way they've come. This was my second Ardbeg after having had the privilege of tasting a 1993 single cask as my first 9 years ago. And it was glorious, the Ten year old i mean ;) Now i am revisiting this Islay gem.  Nose: A vanilla surge then swiftly followed by a creamy vanilla/peat burst that goes on and on. Seashores, seashells and salty seabursts rounds everything off with a strong (yet not imposing)Citrus in the background since the beggining till the end. Palate: As with the nose it's the vanilla that makes the intro for the fanfare, although a sweeter vanilla, that then subsides by a more familiar creamy vanilla making leave for the creamy zesty peat that then caps out with smoke all over the tastebuds. Still Great this dram, oh Boy! The development is dominated by a complex creamy lemon and citrus note that grows more and more complex with peat, holding on alongside it, with the smoke. Rounding off with a finish or rather an ""encore"", or even ""encore-fanfare"" of sorts, with the vanilla, peat, citrus-lemon and this time with added peppers (lime-pepper?) don't know for sure, but what i do know is this that used to be such a good whisky, very much still is... just that. Great Ardbeg 10. Not much intro needed so let's get into it.  Nose: Peat, Dish Soap, Lime, Salt, Creamed Corn  Palate: Big Peat, Sweet Smoke, Fairly Smooth and Oily, Orange Marmalade, Pepper Jack Cheese Finish: Shorter than I expected. Peat, Orange Zest, Charcoal I liked it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy Caol Ila 12, Lagavulin 12 or Lagavulin 16, but that's ok. A solid whisky that everyone should try at least once.  Comments (0) Ardbeg 10. Not much intro needed so let's get into it.  Nose: Peat, Dish Soap, Lime, Salt, Creamed Corn Palate: Big Peat, Sweet Smoke, Fairly Smooth and Oily, Orange Marmalade, Pepper Jack Cheese Finish: Shorter than expected. Peat, Orange Zest, Charcoal.  I liked it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy Caol Ila 12, Lagavulin 12 or Lagavulin 16, but that's ok. A solid whisky that everyone should try at least once.  Since this is one of the most reviewed whiskies around, I don't need any technical details to accompany this review, so I'll just jump right in. Nose: Smoke, citrus, salt and some wisps of vanilla. Campfire doesn't really apply to the nose in my opinion. It seems closer to an industrial smokestack than anything else. Intense, peaty. Palate: The smoke on the palate is closer to a campfire than the industrial smoke from the nose would suggest. Very medicinal. A little bit of sweet honey. Finish: Smoke. Ash. Long, intense smoke. I'm disappointed. This whisky is so beloved by so many. It's intense, yes. But it's not complex. There's more complexity in the similarly priced Laphroaig QC, the Laddie 10, the Talisker 10, and even the lesser Bowmores. I haven't tried much from Ardbeg. And, no, I haven't tried the Uigeadail. And, yes, I'd love to give it a shot. But this is just a blast of smoke without a lot else going on. There are some lesser notes here, but not many. The ones that are seem so overwhelmed by the smoke that they're almost imperceptible. It's balanced and smooth, but it's just too damn simple. Not bad, but not something I'll be buying again despite the reasonable price. Then again, if you're a peathead who isn't in the mood for contemplation and you want a straight-forward daily dram, this is for you. The Ardbeg 10 is an old friend that I have had a few bottles of over the years. It is one of those expressions that an Islay lover like me keeps around consistently in the cabinet. Partially because the pricetag is friendly enough that I can feel semi-comfortable putting it on a holiday gift list if/when someone asks. I love my peat, and Ardbeg is never shy about it. This 10 Year is no exception. Most whiskies are chill-filtered and reduced to a strength of around 40% ABV. The Ardbeg Ten Years Old, however, is non chill-filtered and has a strength of 46% ABV.  The color of this Scotch is always surprising to me as it is so light. Even drinking it by candlelight, it is still bright like a white wine. Looks can be deceiving though…as this drink is no lightweight. Nose: Peat and pungent smoke at first, a plume that needs to escape. The second whiff is where the ocean and sweetness come in. The sweet is tart like lemons. The briny oceanic tints nestle within the peat…think smoked salmon. Palate: Sweet citrus up front, and crisp. Oily, with lots of seaweed and brine before the peat comes back for round two. The smoke is heavier this time, more tar-like. Somehow the whole experience is balanced and smooth despite the peat not being fully tamed. Finish: Salty dryness. The finish is long, and the smoke smolders like a reluctant campfire that refuses to be snuffed out. Conclusion This is for a peat fan and I am an admitted member of the Ardbeg Committee, as I always have one on my shelf. Those that favor the sherried floral drams will likely be a little turned off at first. I always loved revisiting my Glencairn glass the next day with this one. I have intentionally left it out near the sink just so I can smell it the next morning, and the smokiness fills the kitchen. For an Islay fan I have to consider this one for the ‘bang for the buck’ list I will be putting together. But, I digress, the bottom line here is that it is spicy, sweet, and oh so smoky. If you can take a peaty punch in the chin, and can handle the distinctive Ardbeg smoke, you are going to like this one. Peat and more peat plus a little smoke and some sweetness on the nose. Neat palate is peat, some sweetness, and a bit medicinal. Finish is peat and a little sweetness, quickly dominated by BandAids. The BandAid finish goes on for hours. I tasted it the next morning. Adding water increases the BandAid palate and finish. That was my experience. I admit to being a Islay newbie. How can something be so good, yet so bad for you? Ardbeg 10 year old captures the true essence of whisky for you. Like many of the Ardbeg range, it gives you feelings of pure enjoyment in a tough palate. It's your real life Devil's Advocate. Ardbeg 10 is like John Milton a.k.a the Beelsebub, played by Al Pacino. Giving you all you want but wanting something in return. And every time I drink Ardbeg 10, I don't mind giving something away. Whether it's my liver or my brain cells, just be my guest, take it! I'd say that these two have similarities in acknowledgment too. Devil's Advocate got 7.4/10 pts in the Internet Movie Database, which is a good score in there. But I'd still say that it's not generally so highly appreciated. Ardbeg 10 got Jim Murray's 'Whisky of the Year' award in 2008 but based on reviews and my whisky friends thoughts, it's not as popular as some of the other Ardbegs. Only thing that separates these two is that while The Devil's Advocate plot needed some heavy thinking, Ardbeg 10 is not that complex. It's a straight whisky, though it balances well between sweet and smoke. Just like Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) balances between bad and good.  Nose: Starts with a touch of vanilla which introduces you to strong and heavy peat with citrus salt. Taste: Just a great balance of sweetness and smoke. Vanilla is mixed with lemon and followed by heavy smoke. Finish: Sea salted smoke with hints of caramel. And did I say it's long? Yes, loooong. Balance: This is one of the best balanced whiskies I've tasted. When I first tasted Ardbeg 10 it was with great expectations. I'm a huge fan of Laphroaig and Caol Ila, with both hail from Islay, like Ardbeg. I was correct in assuming Ardbeg 10 would have a similar heavy peat-smoke-fire smell and taste! It was the distinct Islay quality I had come to recognize. But compared to Laphroaig and Caol Ila, it felt noticeably weaker. I sipped a bit of Laphroaig directly after the Ardbeg, and found that indeed the Laphroaig was far more intense. This extra intensity of body may not be to everyone's liking, however! So if you like the Islay peat smoke, but don't really like the punch-you-in-the-face intensity, go with Ardbeg! It's still an amazing scotch, and more intense than most other single malts apart from the other Islays. Ardbeg 10 is a much reviewed Whisky. I have no expectations on saying anything new or revolutionary.  The nose is soft yet full, Smokey, salty sea spray with a whiff of burnt bacon. There is a lemon undertone which is covered by a powerful peat aroma. Your first taste brings strong Smoke, fruit, sweet spices with a smooth oily texture. This is a rich peaty punch with a sales caramel flavour. It has a long finish which leaves the tongue tingling and the mouth wanting more. As an experience it is something you want to last. If you haven't tried it buy a bottle! Pound for pound this is a a serious contender. I can't think of anything for the same money that delivers such flavour, quality, complexity and class. After reading so many reviews, about how good this whisky is, I had to try it for myself. Upon opening the bottle strong smell of peat smacks my face and my wife's, who is 15ft away from me. She thought I brought in our Medicine box/container, which actually smells just like my Ardbeg 10. On the palate it is not as heavily peated as the nose would suggest. It is quiet nice,,, hints of orange peel, citrus notes, hint of toffee, and some kind of sweetness in the end. and of course loads of peat and smoke, iodine.... Overall I really enjoy this whisky. I guess my journey to Islay whisky started on the right foot. I also have an un-opend bottle of Uigeadail that im dying to try out  Caol Ila was more peppery and a bit more cantankerous in a good way. Quite a few similarities. Both drams had their own strengths.  I must say that the creosote-like hints in Ardbeg were not ideal. There is a taste that reminds me of diesel fumes and creosote. It's faint but there.  The Ardbeg had a wide variety of flavors, perhaps wider than the Caol Ila, and I liked the hose on the Ardbeg more for sure. Even though Caol Ila is created right by the water, Ardbeg did remind me of the sea quite a bit more, which is nice. A little seaweed and ocean brine crept in there, which I did not detect as much in the Caol Ila.  I had a glass of both up on the bar and gave them a thorough comparison.  Caol Ila 12 wins at 88 points. Two more than the Ardbeg 10. Both are delicious but the creosote and diesel hints in the Ardbeg palette just don't quite work for me. Despite this short-coming, I still liked it a great deal, however, despite the ""industrial"" aspect to it, which the Caol Ila did not have. Standard-Arden som förmodligen är den bästa islayen i den kategorin. The most incredible thing of this whisky is its sea-salt nose. When I first opened the bottle I spent an half hour smelling the cork, adsorbing that beatiful smell of enraged sea, feeling as I was there on top of a lighthouse looking out towards the ocean on a stormy day. The score given just reflect the fact that I didn't yet taste more exclusive Ardbeg bottles which I expect will considerably improve my experience I just've started my journey into the wonderous world of whisky. The better whiskies that is. The whiskies that I'm known with, are Vat 69, Glennfiddisch 12 y.o., Jack Daniels, Johnny Walker Green Label and I recently purchased the very nice Auchentoshan Three Wood, which I really enjoy. But since I only have the Three Wood in my cabinet, I decided to go to my local whiskyshop, to purchase the Ardbeg 10 y.o. because of the fantastic reviews it gets on Whisky Connosr, and I wanted to try something different besides the Three Wood. And boy, do I regret my purchase. Let me tell you why: The Nose: This is where it started. When I poured myself a glass, the aroma of bandaids, jodium, medicinal stuff entered my nose. And shivres ran across my spine. I absolutely don't like this welcome-commitee. But when I got used to the smell, I started to smell things like thick black smoke, and burned wood. Also not very pleasant to me. The Pallet: All those things I just mentioned, came back with a vengeance. The very high peat-levels in this whisky is something you love or you hate. Maybe it is something you must learn to drink, and something I can enjoy when I am a somewhat more experienced whisky-lover, but for now I found it to be an awfull taste. The finish: This was actually pretty long. And when the medicinal taste was gone, it started to taste somewhat like when you have smoked a cigarette. But since I don't smoke (have tried it a couple of times in the past when I was younger) this definitely wasn't my cup of tea either. I am going to keep this bottle in my cabinet untill the day comes, when I can appreciate a highly peated whisky like this one. For now, my search for great whiskies I love continues... taken from furtias.blogspot.com.es/2012/12/… Aged for ten years in Bourbon casks and bottled at 46%ABV. TASTING NOTES Color: Straw. Nose: Peaty, smoky and coastal. Very ""Ardbeg"". Seaweed, iodine, soil, seashells, cider, pepper.  Taste: Powerful and medicinal. Sweeter at first (malty sweetness in fact), then moody. Seawater, seaweeds, burning peat's smoke and some lemon. Finish: Long,medicinal and warming with lots of smoke and iodine. Totally inside a stereotypical Ardbeg's boundaries.  Being a whisky noob I haven't had many opportunities to try different whiskies. Out of those that I've sampled, I found that I enjoyed more the delicate and rich whiskies than the smoky/peated whiskies. I received this bottle as a Christmas present from my father and was worried that it would go to waste seeing that it didn't fit my taste profile. What a surprise, I really enjoyed this! Although it has a heavy peated taste, I found it to be balanced and enjoyable on the palate. I found myself refilling my glass more than once on my first sampling! I thoroughly enjoy Ralfy.com's reviews and as Ralfy said, a peat smoke bomb, like sticking your head in a bonfire! I agree and it just goes to show you, even when your convinced something is not for you, go ahead and try it anyways, you just might find out something new about yourself! Enjoy fellow Malt Monsters ;)  Ardbeg has a reputation of being a very peaty Whisky and one of the finest representations of Islay style single malts. What I would say distinguishes Ardbeg from other Islay Malts is it's well balanced structure. It is a Whisky that perfectly balances strong Islay character with other more soothing notes. It is complex, while delivering just enough intensity to be enjoyable and not overbearing. The Ardbeg 10 y.o. is a perfect example of such a perfectly balanced profile.  Nose: Phenolic tones, peaty, earthy, tones. The nose has brine, sea salt, lots of smoke, burning wood (a bonfire), charcoal, iodine, sea spray, petrol. All these are strong smells but then it also has more gentle notes of lemon zest, orange rinds, roasted coffee, butter, and cream. If you add a cooling Whisky stone you get more intense butter, fresh bread, and bread dough.  Palate: Cream followed by peat and peppers, smoke, clove, sea weed, citrus. Big body, heavy, and thick. The peaty peppers are quite a lasting presence on the palate but they do eventually fade. Once this happens the previously mentioned flavors return. Finish: Oily all the way through a long finish. Very smokey, butter, bitter herbal tea. The charcoal is very prominent in the finish. Very slight heat showing up once in awhile from sip to sip.  Overall, I enjoy the contrasting smells on the nose and the appearance of very strong tastes of peaty and peppers in the palate that are contrasted by cream and butter. The contrasting nose and taste make this Whisky interesting and complex. They balance beautifully instead of conflicting with each other. This in my opinion, is what makes Ardbeg a complex and well balanced Whisky. Two seemingly contradictory smells and flavors that balance each other out instead of compete with each other. Very nice dram.  Full bodied, warm, earthy peated blast. Long slow textured finish. How can one distillery go through, what is fundamentally, the same process and produce expressions that are miles ahead of everyone else? The standard Ardbeg 10 is anything but. Like a young savant it hides the most complex of personalities yet remains buoyantly youthful. As the tangy smoke rises from delicately grilled lemon zest roasting on the grill the chef brushes the main course of sausages with his own brand of special butter glaze. The sweetened smoky peat, mixed with a touch of tincture, remind you where this savant was born. The palate is like eating a soft pudding under a haze of powdery volcanic ash. I never thought words like tar, soot and tobacco could be used to describe something so utterly scrumptious but then I've been proven wrong many a time. A juicy, brightly colored orange kicks in at the last instant re-affirming the massive complexities that lie in this delivery. Smoked bitter gourd, a touch of medicine, tiny oak shavings and a toss of minty leaves finishes up one of the nicest and longest deliveries that have ever had the pleasure of cascading down my fortunate gullet. When I was beginning to explore the single-malt world, I hadn't yet worked my way up to the Peat Giants of Islay when I was introduced by a friend to Ardbeg. Yikes! My first impression was that of a dead pine forest slathered with a layer of Vicks Vapo Rub. But, as they say, it's like hot peppers: at first you gag, then you learn to appreciate the experience, then you love the taste. Even if, just as with the peppers, you still gag occasionally. I'd never start the evening with Ardbeg, but I love this big, gutsy whisky. Can't believe I haven't tried the Uigeadail yet, but I plan to invest in a bottle when my supply of 10 yo gets down to a few drams. This whisky just flat out reminds me of my grandfather. He was a crofter and a peat cutter. I've tried this before and wasn't reminded of him at all but now i can't shake it...strange. Nose: Fresh cut peat, some pipe-smoke; fascinating how the peat and the pipe-smoke can seem so distinct.There seems to be oranges in there too. Mouth: Peaty like half-burnt clods, peat that went onto the fire late and didn't take properly. Now you're taking it off the day after. Behind that is all sorts maybe even chocolate liquorice? Citrus hints again. One or two pleasing burnt notes. Burnt bacon? After: Give up all that violence to a mild, warming finish. It's beyond all belief that such an aggressive whisky should end so politely. A masterpiece. First bottle of Islay, reviewing after having it a week and and a dozen drams. Love the bottle, screams ""I am Scotch! drink me!"" Color is very pale and heavy. Nose: First sweet brine, salted nuts, butter-cream, malt and a little pear. Very pleasing Taste: As soon as it hits the tongue sweet butter-cream up front turning into a smooth, smokey peat and dry salt water with pepper keeping some sweetness from the butter-cream the whole way through. Complexity: You could try to pinpoint flavors all day, each time I have had this a taste other characters and depth. Finish: Very smooth, much smoother than you think its going to be, leaving a pleasant, creamy, smokey brine flavor that is dry making you want more.  My wife and I had gone to Helvetica for a series of whisky and chocolate tastings and we'd finally progressed to the last pairing of the night.  Now this last whisky to be tasted with a chocolate was a whisky that most people would likely think wouldn't be a good whisky for it. I know I was semi skeptical. That whisky was Ardbeg. Specifically Ardbeg 10 yr old. Now I'd had quite a few different expressions of Ardbeg over the last year or so, but I'd yet to try the 10 yr old so I was pretty curious. I was even more curious how well it would pair up with the chocolate. Especially considering that the chocolate was to be malt balls or malteses as I believe they're known in the land down under. For the record I REALLY don't like malt balls. Like REALLY don't like. But first off, let's see this whisky that has everyone talking! So I take the tasting glass and start to nose around and the very first thing that hits me is peat, lots of peat and smoke, almost bonfire type smoke, but at no point does it kill the nose for me, rather it almost enhances the other aromas coming from my glass. Underneath the smoke and peat is a sweetness. Smells a bit like pears and pineapples, vanilla, possibly a bit of apple in there, and along with this lovely sweetness is the always present aroma of burnt band aids and iodine. A very awesome nose that instantly takes me the isle of Islay and Ardbeg! I decide to finally take my first sip of Ardbeg 10 yr old. Now I've tried quite a few Ardbegs before, Renaissance, Corryvreckan, Uigeadail and the mythical Lord of the Isles.  So I had a fair idea of what to expect flavor wise and I wasn't disappointed! The smoke, peat, iodine are all immediately evident in the mouth, but underneath all of that the pears say hello to everyone in the room to. A very very yummy whisky! Pepper appears in the mouth with a small bit of kick and spice, but not unpleasantly so. The finish is long with a smokey flavor and a bit of pepper giving you a kick in the face as it goes down. Quite yum as I have said before! But as much as I love my whisky, the point of this entire visit is to try the pairing of whisky and chocolate. Now the little page we're given when we arrived said that the malt in the chocolate that we're trying with this whisky, the malt balls. Now I take a sip of the Ardbeg and take a cautious bite of the malt balls. And the flavors EXPLODE in my mouth! It's this lovely perfect combination that does indeed bring out the malt inside the whisky and the malt balls in a way that enhances the best flavors of the whisky and the chocolate.  The only way I can describe it is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! Now the tasting notes we were given suggests cracking the malt balls open and sucking the Ardbeg through it. My wife does this after having just tried the malt balls and whisky together and says that this way of drinking the whisky is even better. She actually describes it as lovely. This is coming from someone who while will try smokey and peaty whiskies, will not drink them again once she has tried it. I attempt to do this, but I seem to be having some problems. This is probably due to the fact that I'm a bit of a troll and an utter klutz with anything non animal related. Damn it! I try and try to manage this cracking of the malt balls and drinking the Ardbeg through it, but sadly I have no success. Doesn't matter.  Brilliant pairing! Even better is that Ardbeg 10 yr old is an easily accessible whisky over here in Australia and retails for anywhere from $85 to $110 dollars!  Not too bad! Now this was supposed to be the end of the night, but not for us!  We aren't able to get out here often enough and I'd love to try the new Ardbeg Day whisky and I haven't tried my George T Stagg so we shall be a little while longer! As before the whisky review score can be found down below while the chocolate and whisky pairing score is found right here. Ardbeg 10 yr old and Malt Balls 94/100  Nose: Creamy smokiness, zesty tang of lemon and limes, earthiness, strong peat, slight saltiness. Palate: Oily, buttermilk, strong expresso milk coffee, burnt toast, peat and smoke builds, keeps a creaminess, slight notes of dried pears and banana, some spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. Finish: smoky earthiness, milky coffee, slight roasted nuttiness and roasted maltyness, soft peatyness.  This review isn't going to focus on the particular flavours or aromas of Ardbeg. No. This is more than that, this is about how a great whisky can make you feel.... To add some context, yesterday I had a massive meeting with work. A huge meeting. Since starting my new job, the last couple of months had been building up to this one moment (well three long hours of moments). Anyway, it went well. My bosses took me straight out for a couple of pints. After that, I'd got the taste.  There was nothing I wanted to do more than pick up a paper and settle down in one of my favourite bars in Manchester's Northern Quarter (Common for the initiated). When at the bar ordering my second pint there and a bite to eat, like a shining beacon I noticed the Ardbeg 10 on their top shelf. That was it, I was all over it like a bad rash. Now, obviously I've had Ardbeg 10 before on many occasions and, as a rule, I prefer the Uigeadail. It just has more complexity and variety on the palate, with the added punch of being at cask strength. But in this moment, in this setting, in this mood....I've never had anything better in my mouth than that Ardbeg 10. Wow. Thank you Ardbeg. I love you. This is one of the first single malts i have ever tasted. I love all ardbegs, creamy and oily with a straw like color and a taste of the ocean. Nose: some smoke, some burnt wood, rubber notes- reminds me of band aids on the nose! a little hint of pear and apple. faint notes of pineapple too. i could smell the ocean on this one. Palate: salty, smoke turkey bacon with a medicinal character i cannot fully describe but very enjoyable. yummy clams and oyster's I""m getting hungry here. oh yeah tar and pencil like flavors. Finish: Very long and dry, mouth coating. it leaves a long lasting tingle in the mouth, even a sip of lager beer could not flush away this big islay malt. it hangs in there long and strong! lovely. Does the world really need more reviews of popular young whisky? Definitely not, but I need practice writing reviews so I suppose you'll have to suffer through it. And, this being my first review, please be gentle. Nose: Iodine (called ""medicine"" by some) is the immediate full on aroma. Then follows earth, smoke, and sea spray. One has to work a bit at getting more, but below the surface is the sweet bit with papaya, pineapple, and sweet vanilla all making cameos. Palate: Much like the nose with Iodine, smoke, salt, a bit of white pepper, and vanilla. Body: Quite thick on the tongue. Not exactly oily, but one respects the fact that this is nowhere close to thin. Finish: This is the star of the show. Very long. Iodine is certainly present along with a bit of smoke and an ever so faint reminder of sugar. But the best part of the dram follows as one spends the evening dramming it up, slowly, inexorably, the finish turns to full on white sugar with the Iodine taking second fiddle. I am reminded of my childhood when I had numerous bouts with strep throat. My mother would take a spoon of sugar and sprinkle it with a few drops of Balsam de Malta. For those too young to remember, this stuff was horrid, but as time went on the terrible taste faded, and all I was left with was sweetness in the mouth. Such is an evening with this whisky. I think anyone who simply ""tastes"" it would highly undervalue the component never gotten to. So there it is. Forgive me if my nose and palate do not pick up things as a pro would, but having said that, I recently read a review by Serge where he mentioned mustard seed as an aromatic component. I've been around mustard seed a lot. It is absolutely odorless. Nose: Obviously peaty and underpinned with bonfire smoke. A depth of oil and tar with a raw grassy/hay tinge. Above this floats a nuttiness and scents of dried fruit and candied peel, maybe marmalade and vanilla. All this rambling can basically be summed up by saying that this is really complex nose. Palate: More peat and smoke, but it refuses to overwhelm. All sorts going on here with an exciting tang, saltiness and peppery spice; good depth and complexity that keeps you coming back. Finish: after the relative intensity of the whisky so far, the finish is a deliciously calm postlude of warming smoke. The transition from mid-palate to finish is fantastic. Generally very good; but this whisky gets such rave reviews that maybe my expectations of it were too high and it didn't blow my socks off the way I thought it would...there are other peaty whiskies that I prefer, but this is really very good. The standard Ardbeg the 'King of Peat', the 10 years old. After I tried, his fresher brother the 'Blasda' I want more Ardbeg, so I send here my review of the wonderful Ardbeg 10 yo.  Nose: Strongly wonderful peat with great smokey elements, a fantastic palate of citrus fruits and a good background fragrance of milky Belgian chocolate bonbons.  Taste: With a little splash of water, it is just a pleasant and a joy to take a sip of this Godly Scottisch Spirit, lightly smoky, heavenly peat, citrus/lemon fruits and a light taste of sweet enjoyment. Chocolate, and a good strongly delightfull coffee aftertaste... Finish: Long, devine lightly milk chocolate, espresso coffee, with pear and apple fruit...Still the great peat is on the background. Just a few words from me....Fabulous, Gorgeous, Wonderful, Devine and Superb!!! Totally HIGHLY Recommended. Surely for Peat-Lovers! This is a very funny scotch. Incredibly powerful peat and smoke notes, and an oily mouth feel with a smoky finish. But what's interesting about it is that's all there is. As far as flavor profile is concerned, it's pretty thin. After that lead-in, you might think my overall review would be negative, but it's not. This is a really nice bottle, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into (it falls in the same category as the Macallan Cask Strength in that regard). If you're looking for a heavy load of really great peat flavor, this is a fantastic scotch. And the Ardbeg does it better than many others -- it manages not to be either overwrought, abrasive, or too strong. You can find other Islays (my favorite being the Lagavulin 16yo) that can bring more to the table than the Ardbeg 10yo -- a richer flavor profile, more going on than just peat, salt, and smoke. But you don't have to, and there are many times where a glass of this is exactly what I have in mind. Nose: Immediate peat and sea water, medicinal qualities of course, fried applewood bacon, juicy lemon, sage and browned butter. There's also some grapefruit and blackberries that save this from being too one-dimensional. Water brings out some floral notes. Taste: Warming with burning wood, salt and lime, sea water. Not as peaty as the nose suggests, but of course, still present. It has a wonderfully buttery mouthfeel. Finish: Smoke, bitter citrus, herbal qualities and plenty of peat.  This is certainly a classic example of Islay and Ardbeg, however, I wish the peat had a bit more impact on the palate. My favorite is those tart, fruity notes on the nose that mingle with the smoke and peat. Also, compared with the high strength Uigeadail, Corryvrecken, and Alligator, the 10 year old lacks a little on the delivery. No matter though, still wonderful.  My first review in a long time. The palate always surprises: been off whisky for months, particularly Islay smokey, peat flavoured whiskies. Recently, with the advent of autumn, Irish and Scotch whiskies have come back into my world. I started drinking scotch again, with the Johnnie Walker Green, then the Bowmore, which gave me a subtle introduction to Islay malts again. Tonight, I ventured out to my favourite pub for a couple of drinks and dinner. I had a nice Redbreast before I left. At the pub, I noticed they had a bottle of Ardbeg, so I decided to finally give it a try. The nose is particularly smoke and peat, and I thought: ""Here I go with the Laphroaig experience again. I shared the nose of the whisky with the waiter, a great fellow who's company I have come to enjoy a lot. His description was ""Like and old leather purse."" I nosed it again and, yes, the old leather smell came through, along with vast amounts of peat and smoke, at least to me. Then...the first sip, and I was hooked. The smoke and peat rapidly turned into a wonderfully smooth sweetness, with a wonderful, subtle overtone of peat and smoke. Then, the finish: an almost peppery, spicey burn in my mouth, sweet and also dry at the same time. It made me crave more! I had a second double with my meal, and told my friend that I was going to get a bottle after dinner. Which I did, and now I am enjoying in the comfort of home, Sorry to ramble on, but you haven't heard from me in a long time, and I simple cannot say enough about this wonderful stuff. Easily the most interesting whisky I have ever tasted. The big surprise is, that I can keep on drinking it. Most other whiskies, I need to stop at two or three. This is almost a whisky that, if somebody asked me ""What would be your dream scotch whisky or single malt?"", I would come up with the answer ""A blend of super smooth Highland blended with a peatie, smokey Islay."" It is not particularly thick and syrupy, and is a very light, straw-like colour, normally the opposite of what I really like. My favourite single malt to this point, has been either the Glendronach 12 year or the Glengoyne 10 year which, I might add, is triple distilled for a wonderful smoothness. If I had taken the Glengoyne and the Laphroaig and blended them myself, the Ardbeg is possibly what I might have hoped to achieve. The big Surprise is that, in fact, it is a lot better than what I could ever have imagined! Cheers, Carl Smell : grassy almost floral , reminds me of a meadow in the morning over looking the sea. The waves of salt spray whisping of sweet pungent spice. Colour : Pale golden straw Taste: A brief second of delicate light floral lemon grass flavour then growing in complexity of smoke , sweet , salty , oily goodness. The smoke bellows in waves over the thick rich mouth feel. Finish : A pleasing spicy finish of sea salt and black pepper. Again sweetness almost like eating burnt cotton candy while walking along beach rocks This is where the barrel comes through with wood and spice Overall , Simply wonderful , A Classic expression.  Ardbeg 10 has this softness to it not found in many Islays. It also balances the smokiness perfectly against all the many aromes, not making it overpowering on the nose. I agree with ironlion27. This is the worst whisky I have ever tasted.  The pour looks like white grape juice...extremely pale SRM and very clear. A nice swirl give you slowly cascading, thin legs. Aroma is really out of sight and quite the treat for smokeheads out there. Peat and iodine are restrained in comparison to baked and smoked brisket. Rich potpourri florals and sweet grapefruit cut any savory meatiness or fattiness. No formaldehyde or over the top smoke attributes. Lots of bacon grease, lavender, rich alcohol heaviness and soft booziness. Taste is not so smoke heavy with mild peat and sharp iodine. Lots of mild and warming alcohol spice are complimented by lavender and bitter grapefruit, smoked meat, spicy sausage, chamomile. Very soft on the palate with a long stinging finish but no ""heat"" or excessive warming alcohol. Pretty much zero oak component- which is a godsend. Outstanding. Can't wait to try some special edition versions.  At a whisky tasting at my friend's home, I tasted the Bowmore Surf and Enigma. I couldn't stand the smokey taste of them. When I read the Bowmore reviews, I knew I had to learn to appreciate the Islay taste and I decided to buy a bottle of Ardbeg. After the first 3 drams, I was surprised by the explosion of taste and the balance of the Ardbeg.  Nose: Lots of smoke here. I took me a while to discover the hint of lemon coming through. Taste: The taste is the complete opposite of the nose; Strong citrus, salt, some sweet vanilla and little smoke. Finish: A nice, very long finish. The smoke returns here accompanied by anise. Ardbeg is a wee Islay distillery that has risen to near legendary status, thanks in no small part to claims like this one of Jim Murray’s: “Unquestionably, the greatest distillery to be found on Earth.” (No hyperbole there, I’m sure.) To many, their 10 year-old is a benchmark peated malt Scotch whisky; much like the Lagavulin 16 year-old, the Ardbeg TEN helps to define the genre of the peated, coastal malt. It is not chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. According to the label, this imparts “MAXIMUM FLAVOUR”—and we Connosrs well know that whisky never benefits from being bottled above this strength. The nose is smoked kippers, iodine, cracked pepper, anise, and citrus fruits—most notably lime. There are also hints of clove, orange peel, cocoa, apples, and the merest hint of sulfur. (As an aside, I poured this dram at a tasting some weeks ago. The restaurant staff working in the kitchen and other areas of the restaurant noted the odorous wall of peat that greeted them when they walked into the room. One server claimed he thought he had walked into a distillery.) The palate is damp smoke, vanilla, salt, and smoked kippers, with a touch of citrus, anise, and tar. Limes appear on the finish before giving way to chilis. The Ardbeg TEN is a lovely dram. Sophisticated, complex, and more than just a study in peat.  I tasted this one over the weekend. Not a fan of the peated whiskies, but this one I could get use to. Nose: This one can fill a room with the smell of a camp fire. Good strong smoke scent. Taste: Very rich and full flavor with smoke and peat. There is a hint of sea salt. I was expecting a taste of iodine, but to my surprise, very little. Finish: Long finish. The layers of flavor could almost last the whole night. the king of smoke. very smoky, peaty, iodine, medicinal. this is a very tasty scotch. hardwood smoke, peppercorn and anise. you must like smoky, peaty scotches to adore this one. Well this is my tuppence worth on the Ardbeg 10. this afternoon I had a nice session with my neighbor which involved a Chivas 12, an Ardbeg 10, and a 21 y.o Glenfiddich.  Powerful, slightly woody and lending a strong backing to peat on the nose. the body Packs a nice little punch with an altogether smooth, well rounded and significant tinge of salt and peat. Smokey on the uptake, yet not overly medicinal or ashy. An easy, warm, smoky and considerate finish with a lingering sense of contentment. Overall impression: This is a great drop with distinct Islay qualities, leaving you with a warm feeling and an overall sense of appreciation for the Ardbeg line in general. Doesn't break the bank and marries up well well with a Montecristo 4. A well chosen 10. An 89 from me. Founded in 1815 in the Islay region and currently owned by Glenmorangie. Two fingers with one cube of ice. Very full-bodied. Extremely peaty and almost pungent with a overall medicinal taste. Very spicy but tolerable. Must buy for peat lovers. I had a miniature of this L0 Ardbeg 10, compared to later batches it had a slight acidity (milk acidity) Like the Corryvreckan, this has a smoky sweet nose and the scotch envelopes the tongue on contact. Salt enters after the sweetness, and the finish is very fresh and vegetal. I like the Corryvreckan as well, but this has a slight edge for me and costs a lot less. This is a well-reviewed scotch, so I'm not pretending that I'll really add anything of consequence here other than recording my thoughts for my own benefit. I'm confused as to how to rate this scotch. It only does one thing -- peat -- which ought to count against it. But it does that one thing very, very well. If you want a glass of peat-smoke with some strong, raw malt (cut this with some water!), this is your scotch. So I've got no choice but to give this a nice middling six. After my first sip, I thought ""this is bad""... after two more sips, I was thinking ""this is the best whisky I ever tasted"". I like the taste of the peat. Ardbeg hardly needs any kind of intro, but just for completeness’ sake, I’ll just say this. Ardbeg is famous for it’s very peated malts and hails from Islay. They are considered by many whisky aficionados to be among the best whiskies in the world. This classic 10 Year Old is non chill filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. While I’m still admiring the strawlike color, the scent of peat already permeates the air. It’s dominant, but after a couple of whiffs you can also discover grassy notes and burnt rubber – even a little bit of overripe banana. Putting the Kleenex next to me for my first gulp was somewhat premature. Sure, it’s a peated dram, but it doesn’t burn. It’s very herbal and leaves you with a lingering warmth. That warmth remains during the intense and long spicy finish. Yes, this is classic Ardbeg and should be considered essential to every whiskylover’s cabinet. This is the WORST whiskey I have ever tasted...it made me commit one of the 2 deadly sins of the whiskey world...I poured out a glass of this stuff. The other deadly sin being of course adding more than 2 ice cubes ;) I had to double check across the interweb to make sure that I hadn't been scammed and had accidentally ingested a rotten bottle (if alcohol can rot?) By far the worst drink, much less whiskey, I have ever drank.  Aroma of Windex...taste of Windex...DISGUSTING! Nose powerful - peat, salt and iodine, the smell is very balanced and warm. Citrus, floral notes and vanilla sweetness.
Taste peaty, smoky, salty, slightly medicinal, spicy warmth with a tantalising hint of sweetness , complex, but in a good way, and extremely balanced.
Finish Warm, long, smoky and brillant! Comments A great dram.  Immediately peaty with a touch of smoke blooms into puckering and weaze. Reminder of Glenfiddich without the honey, drier, and peatier. Spiney on the tongue and a taste that rolls away before the feeling does. I tried some Islay whiskies when I first got into malts and I'm not embarrassed to admit I found them a little aggressive on the peat. Whilst Ardbeg wasn't one of them, I mention it because I recently decided to dip my toe back into the Islay waters. I bought this and a bottle of Laphroaig 10 year old (also reviewed) for starters.  The good news is my taste buds have grown up and are now more than ready! To my surprise flavours I may previously have written off as being too full-on revealed themselves in potent and yet somehow subtle layers of complexity. Ardbeg 10 has the expected hit of smokey peat but this is balanced by a lovely sweetness giving way to a salty finish. The overall combination of flavours is truly delicious, well balanced and rewarding.  I haven't been to Islay but I felt breathing in the wind coming off the sea would feel like this.This whisky has a sense of place.  I love it and I can't wait to delve deeper into the Ardbeg range. Nose - Big hit of peat, Medicinal (more so than bottlings of a few years ago), Iodine, Chlorine, Smoky Bacon, Frazzles (corn-based bacon flavoured snack), slightly sweet, Lemon-Drizzle Cake, Peppermint right on the death? Palate - Creamy, smoky, vanilla-laden, oranges, cloves, salty and tangy. Finish - Peaty to the last, but a great creamy seam of flavour runs through the finish. Salty home-made fudge. Water brings out even more peat on the nose, and a real coal-tar character that was hiding behind the barley without water. This is (astonishingly) even better than the 10yo of a year or two ago, when my understanding is that older and rarer casks were being used to make up the blend. Seems that Glenmorangie have really, really got it right with the new production.  Awesome. There's no other word for it. No other distillery in the world has anything anywhere near this impressive as their base expression. The nose is powerful - peat, salt, a little iodine and an underlying sweetness. I can leave it sitting on a coffee table more than a metre away, and within a minute, I get gentle wafts of the smell. Very balanced too, and warm. The taste takes a few seconds to gently and smoothly bloom into a deeply warm, peaty, smoky, salty, slightly medicinal, spicy warmth with a tantalising hint of sweetness - complex, but in a good way, and superbly balanced. Every sip tastes a little bit different, and all of them taste brilliant! The finish is long and warm - filled with salt, smoke and peat with a just enough spice to make sure that your lips tingle for some time after each sip. My first Islay malt was the Lagavulin, and if I were to make a recommendation, that's probably not the dram you should suggest to someone who was just getting into whisky and had only tried the Glenfiddich range up until that point. Suffice it to say, that Islay malts weren't my thing for a while. The Ardbeg 10 year old is the malt that changed all that. While the Lagavulins and Laphroig's have a little bit of a 'punch you in the face and take no prisoners' attitude towards flavour (and that is one of the many reasons I now love them), the Ardbeg is a little more urbane. It has all the elements that make Islay malts great (salt, iodine, smoke and peat), but keeps them within elegantly balanced limits. This isn't my favourite Ardbeg expression (that would be the Uigedail), but it is a genuinely fantastic drink, and the perfect introduction to Islay malts for those who are ready. At least, it was for me. It is just like biting into a piece of salty burnt drift wood. Nose: Peat, leather, caramelized plums, brine and a hint of sweet bourbon (think Basil Hayden’s more than Maker’s Mark) Palate:Lightly peated compared to some other Islays, this whiskey lets the malted barley shine through. As with other peated whiskies, there are definite notes of licorice and iodine. Finish:Despite it’s astringent mouth feel, the taste of peat and iodine stick around long after you swallow this one. A long finish is one of the trademarks of Islay malts, but this was surprising. Comments:This whisky provides a good introduction to peated single malts. It is not overly peated and offers some of the cereal notes and sweetness you get from lightly or unpeated whiskies. I expected a little bit more complexity from an unfiltered whisky though. The astringent quality and pale color are both odd for Islay whiskies. Whiskies from the Islay region tend toward a darker color and more oily mouth feel. This one is good for someone just getting into Islay malts, but I would recommend Laphroaig, Lagavulin, or Talisker (technically from Skye, not Islay, but similar taste profile) over this one."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,57.1,Ardbeg CorryvreckanOB,"Last time I sipped Corryvreckan was summer 2010. That comes as a surprise (well, to me at least) as it is my second favorite Ardbeg trumped only by the Uigeadail. It is named after a dangerous whirlpool north of the island Islay and matured on French wine casks. Every batch is bottled at 57.1% ABV.
The nose offers the classic Ardbeg traits, but with a twist. Powerful, peaty, maritime, but the twist is in the fact that it also offers orange marmalade, oysters, bacon on the barbecue, a hinit of mango and lots of lime juice. This is a veritable battle of sweet versus salt, without there having a clear victor. I think it’s delicious.
Despite the high ABV, it does not need water. Initially you get a good alcoholic kick to the teeth, but that is immediately softened by sweet notes of red fruit and grapefruit. Then the maritime notes kick in to restore order, while the smoke develops as to threaten to make the fire alarm go off. Mightily good.
The very long, dark and sweet, smoky and spicy finish makes me smile and reminisce.
Note to self: get another bottle of this Ardbeg right now. It’s way to good to go without. Thanks, Pat! It's tough to find reliable information on what types of Casks are used to mature Corryvreckan, but the Ardbeg website informs the reader that ex-bourbon casks and new French oak casks are used. There are also rumours of ex-burgundy wine casks  from France being used too (according to The Whisky Exchange blog). Tasting Notes Tall tales about raging whirlpools are unnecessary here. This is an excellent whisky. It’s big, it’s bold, and incredibly balanced. No element dominates, and they’re all  very clear. I’d heard great things about Corryvreckan, yet this still exceeded my expectations. I have not added water to this whisky once. Maybe that’s negligence on my part, but I’ve rarely found a whisky that I liked better with water added. It's a shame the pricing in Ontario is so crazy, because I'd have this on my shelf more often than not. Corryvreckan is more reasonably priced in Alberta and in pretty much any other jurisdiction in the world, so I have no qualms recommending it.  This is my first bottle of Corryvrekan and I'll say right from the off that it has not disappointed in any way.   The bottle has been open just under two months with two thirds(ish) left and I will review neat and with water - I've even gone full on Ralfy and have poured one with water to sit for twenty minutes before pouring a neat one to do a side by side. Neat:  It's lost a little pep after being open a while now but it still gives a full frontal assault on the senses. Nose - Immediately dense and syrupy.  Coal tar soap, TCP, some creamy sherry influence, burnt vanilla, sea salt, liqourice, fennel and anise with some of that signature lime malt note.  A delight! Taste - Sweet arrival, then sour lime and tar notes develop and peat simply attacks the tongue and those anise notes emerge in force.  Mouth feel is superb - oily and syrupy but never cloying.  Good balance of flavours and easy to sip at this strength if you go slow! Finish - Long.  Some bitter sour tannins, with a hint of the red fruit/sherry notes.  Smoke and peat linger for, well, a long time. With water: (1 tsp to a 30 ml pour - it will take quite a bit and keeps shifting but I like to start neat then add a dollop of water after a while) Nose - Distinctly smokier and peatier but everything is more rounded and in harmony.  Chocolate limes (yet again) and more coastal notes - I can smell the pebbles, seaweed and drift wood now.  Less of the sweeter sherry comes through. Taste - A little thinner in the mouth and sharper.  As above but there's more clarity with water.  More of the anise also emerges.  I can't help but think of Tequila. Finish - Long.  This is the sweetspot right here.  It's more sour and the wood comes more into focus but so does the smoke.  This is what I want from Ardbeg at the end - plumes of smoke but here they are woven with fruity sherry notes. This may be the best Ardbeg I've had.  I'd love to try with the Oogy and/or a variety of Ardbegs to compare as I think this would be hard to beat.  As good with water as neat but the finish with water may edge it although I prefer the mouthfeel neat.  In a word, wonderful! Hot spicy herbal smoke filled arrival followed by rich sweet red fruit middle developing a long slow sooty vegetable loaded finish. The reviewed bottle has been open for 9 months and is 90% full Nose: sharp bitter peat, a little sour peat, moderate smoke, lemon, strong brine. This 9 month open bottle has lost some oomph but is still strong. This is a very good nose, especially after 10 minutes of air in the glass. Water added raises the pitch, brings out sweetness, and merges the flavours. With water this is OK, but much of the beautiful complexity is lost. Score: 22/25 Taste: heavy sourness and lemon in the mouth, which overpower and overshadow the peat, smoke, brine, and malt. This is not very good now, and is even worse--more sour--than it was when the bottle was first opened. Water added merges the flavours to a lemon-tinged black licorice. With water this is very different but still not good. Score: 17/25 Finish: it doesn't get any better by waiting, until the taste is all gone. With water added the licorice finish is shortened and then it just fizzles out. Score: 17/25  Total Sequential Score: 73 points Strength: very strong flavours throughout. Score: 23.5/25 Quality: good to very good quality of all of the flavours. Score: 21.5/25 Variety: the overwhelming sourness narrows the range of the flavours available to be tasted. Score: 20/25 Harmony: very good in the nose; not good in the mouth. Score: 16/25 Total Non-Sequential Score: 81 points Comment: my first reviewed bottle of Corryvreckan from Batch L11 012 was @Nock's least favourite known batch of Corryvreckan. This second reviewed bottle of mine, L13 240, is @Nock's second least favourite known batch of Corryvreckan. My bottle of L11 012 got a LOT better after much air exposure (8 months), whereas this bottle of L13 240 has gotten a lot worse with air exposure  I am actually quite surprised at how bad this bottle tastes to me now, because my memory from first opening this bottle was more of a whisky scoring at least 86 points. The bottom line is CAVEAT EMPTOR-- read reviews and pick your batches of heavily peated whisky carefully This L13 240 Corryvreckan is one more example of a very good nose and a not-so-good palate. It would not surprise me if this one were also a case of ""blending by the nose alone"". Distillers and Blenders, NEWSFLASH: MANY whiskies do NOT taste he way they smell. You need to taste them ALL--in your MOUTH 77 point whisky is still very drinkable, but Ardbeg Corryvreckan can and should be much better than is Batch L13 240  Today three of the best I ever tasted shal be tasted side by side. The Corryvreckan, the Ardbeg 10, and the Glenlivet Nadurra. I added a lot highland wellwater to the strong ones, and a little water to the Ardbeg 10. First nose at the Corryvreckan is a bit yeasty, The 10 a bit etanolish,The Nadurra fresh oak, and maybe some tiny menthol. More vanilla.Now more peat comes from the Corry, and also from the 10. The Ardbegs smells a lot better after a couple minutes in the glass. The Ten is more marshy than the corry, which has more oak than the 10. THe bad yeasty and etanolish starts from the ardbegs has dissapeared. Perfect scent now. The Nadurra on the tounge. Very round and soft. The 10 is thinner on the tounge, the Corry is soft too, with some oaktaste, some vanilla,some marshy scent. I might have missed on the 10, and added to much water. It was the last drops from thebottle, so it cannot be fixed. The Ardbeg 10 wins the noserace. I like that marshy peaty nose very good. I think the corry is the richest with most complexity. The difference between the 10 and the corry was a lot bigger than I pre-guessed. All three are very fine whiskys. The cost at vinmonopolet is 850 Nok for the Corry, 570 for the 10 anf 609 for the Nadurra. The ten is diluted, so it is less taste for the money, making its value in the middle of these three. The nadurra is definitively the best buy. I think they all are very good, and that I later will buy them all again. It is nice that they are different. The fresh oakvanilla Nadurra is very different from the marshy peat Ardbeg 10. The Corry is a bit more complex and mainstream than the ten, taking a small step in the Lagavullin 16 direction. Three fantastic drams that are among my absolute favourites. At first the nose is quite surprising with is dichotomous personnality. It is very Ardbeg with its big charred smoke, peat and seasalt; but the big hay, white oak, wet grass by the sea (not seaweed) and tarred hemp rope (to use the expression so well putted by @Fiberfar) is clearly Longrow in my mind. With time the Ardbeg Vanilla is showing. With more air, I have more medecinal herbs, a bit of cardamon and some french oak woodspices in the back. After half an hour, something wonderfull happened, all the flavors kind of melt together finding a good balance. I then have some white and black pepper on a more smokey typical Ardbeg nose with a more prononce than usual sour note. The smoke is huge on the palate! The more air it got the more ashy it becomes. I love ashy whisky! The hay and hemp are there but they are integrated, though they are more defined than the fruity and sweety background. All those flavors are travelling on a continuous thread of vanilla spiced with ginger. The flavors are really expanding from the front of your mouth to your throat and up to your nose. Wow, the finish is long, intense and offers you new flavours! The peat is just explosing becoming meaty! A classical iodine joined the smoke with some medecinal menthol and this finish last for ever. Conclusion, on the first sip, I would have rate this scotch at 84, subtracting 2 points for his lack of balance. In about half an hour of hair, it changes a lot! I would give to the last sip a 91. It could have been close to 94 but it becomes too integrated lacking some definition and reducing the complexity. I am expecting this bottle to settle like my last sip, giving the big role to the smoke and the ash. In that way, I understand why all the people are saying that it is more of a real Ardbeg than the Uigeadail for which I find sometime that the finsh covered the best part of the whisky. The best comment I can do is that I am now craving for another pour of it. So I think I will let you go and have another taste of it just to check a few points and to... Nose - smoke, tar and ash, with water opens up nicely. Palate is very smooth as for strenght, but also very powerfull. After adding some (very little) water, becomes extremely pleasant. Peaty, salty, very rich. Finish is typical for Ardbeg, impressive and very long. Great balance, maybe best recent Ardbeg.  Nose is full of peat - notes of tar (which I always get from Ardbegs, though it is less pronounced here than the 10yo for example), grapefruit & seaweed Salt & sour attack of fruitiness on the palate, some mild sweetness that becomes more savory and a buttery note in the background. Not particularly complex i.m.o Finish is relatively long - smoky with some citrus, peat & malt. Dynamic, assertive and interesting. Have to say that this one is all about the finish which is indeed exellent. I find the nose too young & the taste is a bit in your face. Some love it, I merely 'like' it. It's 'fun' in the way your loudest buddy is, but it's nay subtle... This is the one of the 3 not overly marketed offerings from Ardbeg that are the standard range for a few years now. 9 year old Bourbon and French Burgundy oak aged heavily peated malt, married together and bottled at a very high (cask?) strength. Got it online for €55,- I must say I really like the packaging on this. A sturdy carton box with shiny gold Celtic patterns, bevelled printing, and even a little joke on the side. Appearance: Nice copper colour and thick slow legs. Nose: without water its just a bit too heavy so I put in 2 teaspoons of water in a good +-30ml serve. Tarry smoke, bbq trout, charred fresh oak, medicinal herbal oil, forest mushrooms, pine resin, seaweed, furniture polish, new leather and some dried fruit like apricot and raisins. Its a very big beefy nose with even some flowery smells after a good 5 minutes. Palate: Comes in sophisticated, very quickly and assertive but not overly agressive. Without water its very heavy on the alcohol but not undrinkable at all and small sips are manageable. With water the experience gets a bit softer but certainly more interesting. I like that it really coats your mouth. What I get is: Big fresh charred oak, tar, freshly baked bread, dark earth, JD full flavor smoky BBQ sauce, Jerk pork, cloves, baked Lobster, chalk, seasalt, seaweed, deep sea plankton (in lack of a better term, very organic fishy notes) also after a few minutes I get some of the lighter floral/veggie notes and it becomes a little creamier. Brambles! Finish: Enormous and long, bittersweet and beefy with lots of aromatic smoke, Black pepper, tar, bitterdry oak, dark roast coffee, tree bark, raw organic oil and yes the Islay iodine:)  Wow, this is a very lively, fresh, complex and brutally powerful whisky. Quite alike the Oogie, typically Ardbeg but drier and more complex pronounced oak, but way less fruit. It really couldn't be from anywhere else but Islay, it's unmistakable. You'd think it is older than 9 years as well, the French oak must me of good quality and/or re-charred. If this whisky was a classical music piece, it would be Stravinsky-Rite of Spring or something from Shostakovich. Dark, emotional, a bit chaotic but well performed and sophisticated. Only critical note (for some) that I have is that I couldn't drink this everyday, so intense that it is. An Islay fans must buy for the special moments.

I've been putting off writing whisky reviews on here for a long time. I think the two main reasons for that is being 1) I didn't have enough faith in my own ability to do it properly, and 2) reviewing beer is many times easier than whisky. My bottle of Ardbeg Corryvreckan (L10 168) spent a long time as the big and scary, yet unopened peat monster in my shelf. It's also been open for what is probably an equally long time (close to two years, perhaps?), yet I've only really gotten around to pick Corryvreckan over any other whisky in the last six months. I have noticed that the powerful peat smoke has diminished somewhat since I opened it the first time, but unlike other reviewers, I've not noticed much lemon in it, not then or now (blame it on inexperience, hehe!). On to the notes themselves: Nose: Powerful and intense peat, limestone, some faint citrus, tarred (tar coated) hemp rope, sea spray, salt, smoked bacon, sour woodsmoke, sweet licorice, honey and a hint of tobacco. Water improves the smell of limestone, tarred hemp and bacon. All in all, this gives nice associations to old wharfs. Palate: Full bodied. Sweet smoke, honey, bitter cocoa and dark chocolate, peat. Water brings forth the peat and limestone, and the whisky get a earthly expression. Finish: Long finish, again with the sweet smoke, then brine and dark chocolate. Corryvreckan may very well be what opened up Islay for me. I now regret not reviewing (this) whiskey(s) earlier. Introduced a few years ago as a replacement for the legendary Airigh Nam Beist. It's got big shoes to fill so let's see how it does. Tasted with water and allowed to open up for a few minutes. Nose: Do I need to say peat-smoke? A little bit more earthy than Laphroaig's style however, less of the TCP/Iodine notes although they are still there. A lot of salty sea-spray. A touch of mint, slightly zesty - lemony/grapefruit. Very subtle sweetness - just a hint of white chocolate. On the palate I get minty-sweetness with loads of smoke but with a strong prickly bite. So adding a little more water..... And that has softened it up more, allowing the earthy peatiness to dominate but with almost herb-like backing flavours. Citrus returns, the mint fades. Hints of chocolate remain. A curious combination.  It then leads to a wonderfully dry briney finish that lasts. In fact I'd say the finish is the best part of this whisky but I am a fan of dry lingering finishes, (hence my love of Clynelish). It's one of the more subtle Ardbegs if there is such a thing. Not as good as Nam Beist, (but I do think that was a one-off never to be repeated malt). It definitely works best with water and time allowing it to open up. The bottle itself has been open a few months too which might aid it. In price/value ratio probably not quite as good as Uigeadail but better than the 10, (which although an excellent whisky, I think is very overpriced nowadays). I just realized that for some reason or another I have not posted a review of this batch. When I first met @Victor we tried his bottle of this batch. I thought it was a decent or average batch, and he thought it was the best his bottle had ever tasted after being open for 2 years plus! Some time later I realized that I actually had a bottle of this batch in reserve . . . so I opened it to see what my experience would be. After several tastings here is what I have found with my bottle:  Nose: More astringent then the L09. This is lemon, iodine, and astringency all punching you in the face. There is something dusty, peaty (smoky?), and earthy lingering in the background . . . but I am not sure exactly what it is given all the intense lemon and iodine. This is less about moss and way more about paint thinner. There is citrus (lemon peel-ish), some diesel, asphalt, and other mechanical equipment notes. There is an underbelly of peat but this is a thin and sad comparison to the gorgeous L9. With a little time I get down to earth and dirt to match the peat. Also I am getting some sweet notes . . . almost too-sweet ice cream of the vanilla variety. Yes, time is really needed to balance out this nose. Taste: Same sweetness (perhaps the highest sweet tones of the night) as the other Corry batches I have. This really tastes like you are drinking Splenda and water with a hint of peat moss and a touch of smoke. Not impressive. Finish: Huge explosion of power, sea salt, iodine, and a little peat. The pepper is outstanding: tons of black peppercorn, sea salt, and cayenne. Tons of fire power and spice. That said, there is none of that depth and earthiness I get from the other two batches of Corry tonight. I take that back – there is a hint of that “liquorish” note, but only at the very end. Complexity, Balance: Not the most balanced or complex of the Corry batches. I dislike the extreme sweet and strong lemon. I find the balance off. With time the nose found itself . . . but then it would get lost again. Aesthetic experience: I really love this bottle. Everything about it is wonderful, name, ABV, bottle color, nickname . . . except for the label getting sucked into the whirlpool, which seems tacky to me. All three expressions are spot on for color. The L9 might be a hair darker (or it is just my imagination).  Conclusion: @Victor has said that this batch started off with tons of lemon up front, but that after for about two and a half years it finally balanced out. My finding absolutely confirms this. This bottle has only been open since December 4th of 2013 so I’ll see how it does after a year. This batch isn’t as bad as the L13 240 . . . but it certainly isn’t anything to seek out. I know that in a few years that lemon should recede . . . but who wants to wait that long? I’m off looking for the next batch.  This is a recent bottle that I bought and opened on March 11th. I have tasted it on a number of occasions, but I have only made proper notes 3 times now (one occasion against 3 other batches of Corry, one time against Laphroaig 10yo CS 005 and Lagavulin 12yo CS 2010, and once against other random peated whiskies). I was waiting to do a fourth tasting . . . but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. So with hesitation here is my opinion:  Nose: Very sweet . . . super sweet. Then comes the sour lemon . . . dang. This has the least going on up high and so seems the least intense of four different Corry batches. The sour tone is all up in your face. It is hard to get around it to find the peat. All I am getting is sweet and sour. Lets give it time . . . only marginally better, but I am getting a little bit of dark chocolate in the far background. I don’t love this nose. This is very uninspiring compared to Uigeadail, Laphroaig CS and Lagavulin CS. And for all its power it has a very weak and subdued nose. I like it for the peat, which at best is only 1/3 of the flavor. It is enjoyable in an “Ardbeg” way, but there is nothing to intrigue me here. That said, I have to keep in mind that I am directly comparing this to other really great cask strength (or close) peat monsters.  Water totally subdues the nose . . . it turns down to a whisper.  Taste: Sweet . . . way too sweet . . . like saccharin sweet. Almost bourbon-ish. There is a ton of caramel, sweet, and now salt. TONS of salt, but only a little peat to mix with the oak flavors.  Finish: Smallest wave of the four Corry batches. But the salt lick is super long with tons of salt and peat . . . and salt. Now there is that deep Ardbeg black peat, wood, and strong liquorish note that I love. This was a big finish of power, powder, sawdust, peat, and smoke . . . but lacking in complexity. Still, that depth and overwhelming dark peat tone almost makes it all worth it.  Complexity, Balance: This might be the most unbalanced Corry I have ever tried. I don’t get it. It is all about sweet tones and then sour tones. It totally masks the peat, earth, and ash that you typically find in Ardbeg.  Aesthetic experience: Easily the darkest of the four Corry batches in color tonight. Love this bottle. Not much to say about a great name, story, ABV, and nick name. If you have read this far (and any of my other reviews) you need to know that I really do give points based on the bottle and packaging. I think it subconsciously influences our enjoyment of a whisky. So I am trying to proactively take this into account. I enjoy most everything about this bottle. If you only care about the liquid inside . . . then this section of points would be far lower.  Conclusion: I already said this in the “Complexity” category: unbalanced, strong on the sweet and sour, weak on complexity and peat. The best part about this batch is the finish. That said, this is the worst batch of Corryvreckan I have come across. Avoid! I am rating this an 82 because of the finish and the Aesthetic Experience of drinking a 57.1% Ardbeg. However, I could easily see this being rated in the 70’s by someone who doesn’t have a huge soft spot for high-powered peat monsters. While I’m admittedly reluctant to become an Ardbeg fanboy, there’s no getting around the fact that their whisky is consistent, their adherence to quality is respectable, and their house style is something to behold. And if you are an Ardbeg fan, you need the Corryvrecken. They’ve done away with the lower abv of the 10 and the sherry of the Uigedail here, and we’re left with a big, intense beast of a whisky that personifies the house style, in my opinion. As Serge recently mentioned on whiskyfun; this is one of the Ardbeggiest Ardbegs out there. Nose: Intense peat that is unmistakably Ardbeg. Maple, honey, citrus, oak, bacon, petrol, earth, metal, minerals, pine, and a potent brine. The flavours are crisp, clean, and industrial.  Palate: Quite rich and mouth-coating. I’m liking this mouthfeel. A powerful rush of classic Ardbeg flavours follows. Peat, petrol and smoke come on strong. The intensity of the peat is initially overpowering, but on closer inspection we start to notice some beautifully integrated citrus and honey. Lemons, oysters, seaweed, limestone, and smoked bacon.  Finish: Long and big. The flavours keep coming for ages. I’m enjoying the barley here. Aside from the ever-present peat, there’s a subtle farmy quality here with hay, barley, and wheat. There’s also a rich meatiness. Sorry; porkiness. Glazed ham and smoked bacon, to be specific. Ironically, what started off heavy and industrial soon trails off into something quite refreshing and natural. The tail end of the finish offers us flavours akin to mineral-rich spring water. Interesting. This was a fun one to review. Not only because I just invented the word “porkiness,” but I also got to really explore this stuff; something I hadn’t done in ages. I have to admit; I thought I had this one pegged a long time ago. But having just explored it again, I’m inclined to toss an extra point or two its way. The Corryvrecken offers up loads of flavour and intensity with classic Ardbeg flavours. It translates beautifully from nose to palate to finish. But there’s still a fair bit of evolution going on; particularly during finish. While I don’t appreciate the price tag on this one, I can’t deny that it’s good. If your into Ardbeg, this them at their most honest. Very recommended.  Un nez iodé (iodine), vernis (varnish), avec de la ficelle (string) rappelant une grappa italienne, plus un soupçon de sirop d’érable léger (light maple sirup). Une fois en bouche, c’est l’avalanche de tourbe (peat), de terre (soil), de charbon (coal), de souffre (sulfur). Métal (metal), granit, poivre (pepper). Un final sur des écailles de lave (scales of lava), de fumées (smoke)et de cendres (ash). Yes, I'm one of those. The die-hard Ardbeggians that will fight tooth and nail for this whisky and climb mountains to defend it's honor! Now that we have that established let me tell you this particular expression fails to ignite extravagant fireworks.  It is good in it's own right but it is not magnificent. This one under review has the code L12 302 13:31 6ML etched on the bottled making it a late 2012 bottling.  The nose is what you would expect from this untamed spirit. Like standing on the coast in the midst of peaty hailstorm with your weathered fish nets hung across your shoulder. The smell of tar and road works emanates from beneath your leather galoshes. The reluctant tangerines and honey are there but understandably subdued in the face of this charr-y onslaught.  The peat is strong on the palate while the charr pounds everything into soot. The peppers, some vanilla and that familiar lemony citrus get the same overdone treatment. At 57.1% ABV this one is not for the faint hearted. The sooty diesel finish stays for a while gruffly ordering you take another sip. This is a good Corry. Just not the best one I've tasted. Gonna be honest.. I'm a fan boy when it comes to Ardbeg.
Muscular, peaty, powerful and smoke bacon fat. Is it just me... I get a bit of laphroaig's signature smoke, which I love. I've always wondered what it would be like if you mix Ardbeg n Laphroaig, and I think I've found it, it's Corryvreckan. My top 3 dram.  I'm a big fan of the Islay Single Malts mostly because of their peatiness (if that is a word). Ardbeg Corryvreckan is the epitome of what Islay has to offer Single Malt enthusiasts. It's nose embraces you, heck it drags you in.. If you love the smell of a wood buring fireplace, then you'll love this dram.. It's full of flavor, very rich and smooth.. People who are used to the Glens, will probably be shocked.. Wow what a kick in the mouth. I picked this up and only now reviewed it out of the fact the thing has kicked me in the teeth. Nose:Smoked Fish( maybe mackerel), salted chocolate, orange, chili peppers, tarry coffee, peat, strong pepper, smoke, bacon. Palate: Pepper, smoked fish, salted chocolate, orange, chili peppers, smoke, bacon, coffee. The taste actually takes turn in my mouth in waves but it will make you feel like you are drowning. Finish: Smoked fish, salt, pepper, bacon. So what a ride, quick and powerful with a nice fish and salt flavour to balance out the heat. All in all you cannot go wrong with any of the ardbeg line. BAM! This is one bold Dram. Take no prisoners peaty, spicey, and thick. A wonderful nose reminiscent of a Peppercorn steak on the BBQ. I'd imagine an evening on the beach on Islay barbecueing steaks and fish over a roaring fire. There are bitter espresso/coffee nuances alongside pudding. This has to be one of the most difficult tastes to decipher. There is so much to this one. Add a wee bit of water and enjoy. Try it and you'll never get bored with it. Too expensive in Ontario @ $180. Buy in USA at approx. $80. Slainte Mhath!  Bought and opened in Virginia 9/15/2013 (Yes, they have Corry bottles from 2011 just now on shelves here in Virginia) Tasting along side L9 231 and a bottle of Uigeadail L13 058 for reference on 9/16/2013, Nose: Strong lemon at first. Much more “soaring” tones here then the L9 bottle. A slight sour note that the old L9 doesn’t have . . . did the sour note disappear? Or is this just pumped up lemon peel? There is a similar formaldehyde note . . . but there is a surprising lack of depth! Where the L9 had all this dark rich earth and peat bog this L11 is extremely strong lemon peel with a slight base of peat. Now I am getting those same spicy oak notes that I am associating with European oak. Very nice. Compared to the L9 this is a strong tenor. After some time (and air) I am really picking up on some nice diesel tones behind this huge lemon. Slowly I am drawing out the earth and peat bog from the L9. Wow I just got a hint of that bittersweet chocolate (just for a second). This is quite remarkable: basically, all the colors from the L9 are here; they are just arranged in a slightly different way. With time . . . I actually think I am picking up on more in this new bottle then in the old L9. I think I am getting some Indian spices here . . . crazy! It just really takes time. And after more time I am back to enjoying the L9 . . . it really is an “in the moment” type thing. Needless to say, both are highly enjoyable.  Taste: Lovely sweetness, then balanced out with lemon . . . now peat and sea salt. Finish: Huge power . . . wave upon wave of undulating peat fire, smoke, peat embers, burning oak logs . . . a fresh Corry is a muscle bound power house! I love it. It does start much stronger then the L9. But does it last longer? Difficult to tell. Balance, Complexity: Very complex. I am actually surprised. At first I thought it was a far less complex batch then the L9, but with time this 2011 bottle showed it carries the same DNA. The balance of the lemon was a bit off. Aesthetic experience: This is a fantastic bottle. LOVE the near 100% British proof at 57.1%. This is probably my ideal ABV for Ardbeg (mainly because it doesn’t come at 70%!) My only dislike is the lack of symmetry on the label (where the whirlpool drags the ship, name, and boarder off the side. I just prefer the Uigeadail label more. Conclusion – I really liked my first bottle of Corry from 2009 a great deal. I have tried a sample of @Victor’s bottle (different batch also from 2011) that was very similar to this batch. I think the DNA has been extremely consistent - more so then Ardbeg TEN or Uigeadail! The L09 was more complex, but these L11's are still highly enjoyable for me . . . and I think I like them more then a standard Uigeadail bottle. Something about the European Oak spice is more up my alley then sherry casks (which is American Oak).  I know many people morn the loss of the Airigh Nam Beist . . . but I would much rather be drinking this then the Beist. But that is just my taste - and this is a totally different ""Beist""  This is from one of the first Corry batches (not the Committee release) to hit the USA. I opened 12/25/2009; re-bottled 11/2/2012 . . . yes . . . really that long. Most of the time the bottle was over ¾ full. I decanted it into a 200mL bottle. Tonight’s tasting (9/16/2013) is from this 200mL bottle that is now half full. Nose: Lemon and sea salt greet the nose. For a moment it is all light and high tones. And now the plunge into the depths . . . formaldehyde gives way to leather and then deep rich earth with tons of moss. This is ancient stuff here! Peat bog mixed with wood . . . now more oak is emerging with tons of spices. I really can tell the impact that European oak brings: spice and no vanilla! Now, a turn to musty old books, diesel smoke in the background, and other Ardbeggy type notes. Not terrible sweet. After nosing the L11 I get a ton of dark bittersweet chocolate. This is most certainly a deep baritone note. Now a whiff of lovely pipe smoke (perhaps a cigar?) and then some pine needles. Every time I come back to this guy there is something different. I would summarize this as a nice balance of formaldehyde, earth, spice, lemon, peat bog, with hints of diesel and bittersweet coco.  Taste: Lovely peat, sea salt, burning logs, salt lick, and rosemary rub. Finish: Big wave followed by that huge Ardbeg intake of breath . . . now the tidal wave of Ardbeg power! Awesome power and face decimation. Waves rolling in of peat fire, soaked moss covered logs, oaken furniture, leather, moss, peat . . . amazingly big and lovely. Balance, Complexity: Far more balanced then the fresh L11, and it has an edge in complexity here as well. The balance of the lemon, spice wood, peat, sweat, and earth was amazing. Much better then the L11. I loved the interplay of the rich earth, the moss, the peat, and the diesel with the hints of sour, bittersweet coco and formaldehyde. Aesthetic experience: This is a fantastic bottle. LOVE the near British 100 proof (technically 57.15) at 57.1%. This is probably my ideal ABV for Ardbeg (mainly because it doesn’t come at 70%!) My only dislike is the lack of symmetry on the label (where the whirlpool drags the ship, name, and boarder off the side. I just prefer the Uigeadail label more.  The primary reviewed bottle, bottle code L11 012, meaning that it was bottled on January 12, 2011, has been open for a little less than 2 1/2 years, and is currently 60% full. Protective gas was used for the last 11 months. This review traces changes in this particlular bottle throughout its history, and, more importantly for me, the gradual change in my own whisky tastes which also occurred during this period. This review will be in non-sequential format: SQVH. Ardbeg is probably my favourite Scottish distillery, and I have liked almost everything I have tasted under that name. Ardbeg Corryvreckan has been a whisky which has received near-unanimous praise from those who like strongly flavoured peaty/smoky Scottish malts. Until recently, though, for me, Ardbeg Corryvreckan was clearly my least favourite among the other Ardbegs of which I currently own bottles: Supernova 2010, Uigeadail, Airigh Nam Beist, Ten, Ardbog, and Galileo. It is not that I don't like the big, bold, vivid flavours--I would drink almost all whisky at 80% ABV if I could. No, it was because I didn't like the particular flavours of Corryvreckan, and even more so, for the first 8 months it was open, my particular bottle of Corryvreckan. All of my impressions of Corryvreckan changed about 2 months ago, when, while sampling some again with a visiting friend, @Nock, I liked samples from my own, or any other, bottle of Corryvreckan a great deal for the very first time. The whisky hadn't changed much in the last 18 months. I realised that some elements of my taste had changed, however.  Strength: the flavours of Corryvreckan are big, bold, strong, powerful, and vivid, on nose, palate, and finish. They were when I opened the bottle, they are now, and they have been from every sample I have had of Corryvreckan from my reviewed bottle and from every one of the several other bottles from which I have sampled. Score: 24/25 pts Quality: when first opened, my bottle of Corryvreckan had overwhelming flavours of sour lemon citrus, so great, in fact, that they even greatly masked the intense gravelly petrol-like mush of earthy peaty/smokey flavours also present. This overbearing tart lemon citrus lasted about 8 months after the bottle was opened, and I didn't like it. After it finally faded away, my bottle of Corryvreckan tasted very close in flavour to that of other bottles of Corryveckan from which I have sampled. Corryvreckan is reported as a 5,000 bottle release. Within that 5,000 bottles are stamped different bottling dates. So, how to describe typical Corryvreckan flavours? First, I note that the nose flavours translate well to the palate. The barley flavours highlight lemon citrus, and a rather high-pitched set of flavours from the malt. The smoke is substantial, though it has over time largely dissipated in the nose. Even 30 months of the bottle open, smoke is still very prominently tastable on the palate. There is substantial noticeable brine, i.e. salt, iodine, seaweed, all of that Kildalton Islay Undertow. The peat flavours of Corryvreckan are quite complex and layered. Some of those flavours are vivid, and petrol like, expressing generally very low bass type notes. Baso Profundo, you could say. Some of the low peaty flavours are rather indistinct and sort of blend in to a mush of low gravelly, earthy, dirty flavours. Those gravelly bass flavours were never great favourites of mine, because much was indistinct mishmash, and I didn't especially like the petrol flavours, per se. Much of that class of flavour comes across to me as what I describe as anise/black licorice, and I didn't used to like a lot of anise/black licorice flavours in my whisky.  Well, something happened to me 2 or 3 months ago, and I now can more enjoy strong anise flavours in my whisky, whereas previously they just tasted out of balance to me and rather unpleasant. So, how I would thus describe the flavours: tart lemon citrus, high pitched malt, moderate brine, and a collection of bass petrol/earthy/smokey/anise-y flavours. In sum, I always liked the vividness of the flavours. Now I also like the nature of the individual flavours a lot better. Score: 23/25 pts (until recently I would have scored the quality of the flavours at 19/25 pts)  Variety: the number of flavours and contrast have always been more than adequate. Score: 23/25 pts Harmony: I still don't think that these flavours have much natural harmony combined together. It is the individual quality and beautiful intensity of the flavours that make this work. Score: 21/25 pts  Concluding comment: accepting of, and enjoying of, a lot more lemon citrus flavours and a lot more anise flavours in my whiskies have been the two main changes I have seen in the multi-year evolution of my whisky tastes. I consider it to be a very good thing that those changes have been in the direction of learning to enjoy a wider variety of flavours, thus increasing the number of whiskies which I can wholeheartedly enjoy drinking. I advise the reader: you might very well find yourself liking some additional whisky flavours down the road, in additon to only those which you like today. Slainte!  I opened the bottle, poured some in my glass - n ot much nose to speak of and at first sip (uncut) very aggressive - bites like hell. When I added some water it improved, but not by much. Later in the evening (I had other whiskys around) I returned to it, to find that it has developed somewhat, and had a better experience. At the end of the day the bottle lost a few drams and went back to the cabinet. A few days later is was ""Corry alone"" night - no comparison. Still bites, but gets much smoother with water - I needed much more than any single malt I ever tried. Still - not much in the nose. Pallate developed some subdued fruitiness and much less peat than I expect from Ardbeg. Having said that, the peat comes out full tilt in the finish, which is long and amazing - this is where it fully meets my expectations. Another weird observation is that when the glass is empty, the nose is much stronger (and lovely) than when it contains the whisky?! Overall: For me Corry needs bot some air (much better the second evening - I have now a half bottle and I will leave it for a month before trying again) and plenty of water. It seems to have the capacity for greatness, but I don't like the bite - I would love all the ingredients left to mature together in a cask for another 4-5 years. As is, the best things are the incredible finish and the nose of an empty glass. One more thing - I wish the lable said what's in it - I would love to know the ages ov various vintages and any pertinent information, just as I can read on a wine bottle it contains 78% Cabarnet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 3% Cabarnet Franc... Good whisky with an unrealised potential for greatness IMHO!!! This bottle has been in my cabinet and open for a year. Finally finishing it today, so it's definitely well breathed. Without water: Creamy nose with salt and strong but mellow peat-smoke. There's also a slight toffee sweetness not dissimilar to the Airigh Nam Beist. A hint of green apples too. I find the creaminess to be the overriding aspect. Palate - initially salty toffee with the peat arriving later. Still a little bit creamy too - toffee ice-cream?  The finish without water is a tad overpowering. With a few drops of water added I'm finding the peat takes charge on the palate and particularly finish - which is smoky, very drying and long lasting. Hmmm - I prefer the palate neat, but the finish with water. Corryvreckan is an absolutely superb whisky in its own right. But the problem with Ardbeg now is that the bar was set so high with the Nam Beist that even the best of the modern range can't top it. So let's not directly compare - this whisky is brilliant and even with a slightly lofty price tag it is still great value. This was the second dram for our Ardbog Day 2013 celebration. We paired it with steak and eggs (a poached egg split over rare filet mignon).  Color: reddish gold Nose: It always seems somewhat closed to me initially, time and persistence pay off though, salt spray, hay bales, hint of lime, peat smoke, earth, rubber, pencil eraser (the pink one), smoked almonds, some evergreen and honeysuckle. A little splash of water brings the limes and floral notes forward some. Palate: full bodied and oily, sweet and hot, big peat, salt again, pepper, citrus, tarry smoke, charred green onion, evergreen, faint molasses, then becoming dry and prickly Finish: long sweet smoke and chili heat Overall: A salty, brooding dram, I have revisited it multiple times and appreciate it more each time. Good stuff. Food note: worked splendidly with the steak and eggs. Note that the tasting note is before consuming any food (I think context is a huge factor with whisky tasting).  The Corryvreken's mystical bottle design portends ominous tidings indeed! As I huddle in my dark drafty cave and gaze upon my row of potential drams by the dim flickering candlelight, i find myself peering apprehensively at the ancient black label with twisted lettering that almost seems to swirl. What sorcery is this?  Unbiddingly, the nectar is poured and a sense of impending doom overomes my senses... Nose: Wafts of clorox bleach. Pungent overripe orchard fruit with slight sulfur notes. Sharp sea air. Lemon pinesol. (A must: let empty glass sit for a while, then nose it...just awesome aroma!) Palate: 'In yo face' sharp and bitter notes with salt 'n pepper. Upfront smokiness with peat in background. Sweet and savory nonetheless with a touch of speyside. Mouthfeel is moderately thick. Finish: oven-baked bread, sweet and salty. A surprisingly clean finish with lingering smokiness.  Overall: Need to brace yourself for this dram in my opinion. A potent brew indeed. Watch your fingers and toes while climbing on the rocky bluff in the swirling storm.  Comparisons: Compared to Lagavulin 12CS, it is more rounded with a speyside-like sweetness, but not as well integrated and lacking some depth. The Laphroiag Quarter Cask is much more approachable, but with really no depth and too sweet. In isolation, all are enjoyable drams, but is fascinating how different they really are when compared directly. No water was ever added to any drams. Nose: After first pour, you notice smoky salt: The smoke is of the ashy variety, and the saltiness is sharp-- as if flavored with lemon crystals or another nose-stinging additive like pine or menthol. A little breathing brings out a more sweet/umami character, giving the impression of fatty salt pork or maple bacon frying. The mentioned sharpness is lighter, as if fennel seeds have been tossed in the pan. Palate: A sequence from sweet honey, to rounded ashy smoke..., and then to the sharpness of salt and oil. Peppery earth comes in for a period...., and then this passes to nutty coffee as it enters the finish. Finish: The nutty base sustains and is joined by tangy citrus, for the expected long finish. If you're looking for it, continuing to swallow can get you the impression of charred sea scallops doused in lemon & pepper.  Compared with other top-rated Ardbegs, the Corryvreckan is the more serious expression. From the Uigeadail to the Alligator to the Corryvreckan, there is progressively less sweetness, more acidity, and more saltiness. So in relation, I find this unbalanced and even a little jarring. Nevertheless, I understand the appeal to scotch drinkers preferring a harsher concoction: something that's quite pleasurable to drink while still reminding you you're alive (and perhaps boosting machismo points).  I just broke open this bottle. I have to admit I haven't had much experience with the Islay whiskys. I have only had the Lagavulin 16yo thus far. First the nose... waves of smoke as I had expected. I added a few drops of water, but I don't think it made much difference. This whisky has an intensity that just doesn't quit. As I write this, it is some hours later and I can still feel the smoke permeating my body. I did like it, but I think I need to work up to it as a regular whisky in my lineup. Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. Ardbeg Corryvreckan was released in 2008 and is named after the world’s second largest whirlpool, located between the islands of Jura and Scarba. The nose is surprisingly delicate and full of fruity flavours, mostly lemon and oranges. Then come smoked ham and tar, followed by peaty notes. With water the nose gets even fruitier, with bitter chocolate also making an appearance. The palate takes center stage with a bang! It is full-bodied and rich, virtually coating the tongue in salt and earth. It is also quite peppery, which is hardly astonishing given the high ABV. Again there are lemon and oranges. With water the earthy element becomes more pronounced, and coal smoke is released, followed by more lemon and oranges. The finish is very long, very dry, as well as peaty and peppery. In addition some brine has now sneaked in, everything being well balanced. A terrific finish! Adding water subdues all elements a bit. This is my favourite Ardbeg expression! I simply love how it starts with a delicate nose, luring me into a relaxing drinking experience, and then strikes hard with its mighty palate. I can virtually taste the earth, salt and peat in this palate – fantastic! Given the high ABV you might think that this is best enjoyed with a drop of water but in my experience the water subdues all the fun elements, which is why I prefer the charming abrasiveness of the full-strength Corryvreckan. This was my first Ardbeg experience and what a way to start! It felt like I'd been acknowledged to a some sort of underground club. The way this whisky was treating me, it surely was the Fight Club. Only exception is, I want to talk about it. Ardbeg Corryvreckan kicks your ass in a good way. It's raw but also a bit sophisticated at the same time. Giving me lots of small details buried in the heavy camp fire smoke. According to Ardbeg, Corryvreckan takes its name from a famous whirlpool in the north of Islay. In that case they couldn't have picked a more suitable name for it. Nose: Very intense smoke, smoke fried bacon with tar and pine trees. This dram is playing with heavy peat! Taste: Nicely salty and smoky, richly peat. Some oil, spices and medicinal appeal. Finish: Peat and smoke collide with small oil drops mixed in there as well. Balance: Like having a camp fire barbeque in whisky heaven. This whisky is just the way I want it, a tough customer if I may borrow some hockey talk. En Ardbeg för de finare tillfällena. Magisk balans mellan rökighet och sältan från havet. incredibly complex. Sharp sea salt, seaweed, bacon, and honey (butter?) nose. Peat smoke, sweet salted nuts, chocolate and coffee, slight hint of orange zest and wow fudge? with a very long, spicy sweet finish with smoke and pepper. An Awesome Ardbeg. Tonight - my birthday dram! Now entering my 41st year, I thought I'd celebrate with this incredible whisky. I had a sample at a tasting @Victor gave, but I bought a bottle the first opportunity I could find. I think this is the first Ardbeg I've owned (and so the first Ardbeg I've reviewed). One of the three Kildaton-area distilleries (the others being neighbours Lagavulin and Laphroaig - what a trifecta!), Ardbeg was first licensed in 1815 and was used almost solely in blends. It was mothballed in the 1980s but slowly came back, helped along by being purchased by Glenmorangie in 1997. Since then, it has come back with a vengeance and is now recognized as one of the very top distilleries, with it's core 10 Year Old as well as various other more premium expressions. And The Corryvreckan? Well, it's the second largest whirlpool in the world (google it - neat pics!) The packaging will tell you the whole legend of the Viking going into the whirlpool for his ladylove, and how it relates to the whisky, blah blah blah. Excellent example of romantic marketing (which Scottish distillers excel at). But what about the liquid?  It is a shimmering light golden colour. A fantastic nose: lemon, peat, seaweed, pine needles, wet dog. Medicinal. Hot, light and very pleasant - fruity citrus notes carried by the gentle peat smoke. Water accentuates the seaweed and iodine. Just smoky enough to carry all the other elements beautifully. In the mouth: wow. Extremely mouth drying yet also oily. Very smoky (a wet, clingy smoke) but behind that, some light honey, light brown sugar, milk chocolate, lemon tart, grapefruit, very briny. Water makes it sweeter, which goes miraculously well with the rock salt and peat, makes it much fruitier. Stings the lips and dries the mouth. Extremely complex whirlpool (there's that marketing again!) of flavours: salt, smoke, tart, sweet - incredible. I'll be sitting with this for a while... The finish is long but not too long. The smoke hangs back and allows the sweet maltiness to come forward. The balance of this whisky is perfect. Each element is slightly different yet complements the other in total harmony. This is as good as it gets. This is why I always come back to Islays - nothing on Speyside comes close to this (well, except the Macallan 1946, which was peated, so there ya go). And this is why Ardbeg remains one of my top distilleries. Slainte! And Happy Birthday! So my wife and I had finally made it to the whisky bar, Helvetica, for the first time after months of trying and suffering setback after setback. We'd had a very good evening so far, enjoying a Glenfarclas 12 yr old over dinner, then a Yamazaki 12 yr old, Hakushu 12 yr old, Glenmorangie Nectar D'or together at Helvetica, after which my brother and sister joined us at Helvetica for Amrut Fusion, Glenmorangie Astar, Aberlour Abunadh batch 35, and our last dram being the vaunted Old Potrero 18th Century Rye. Now it was time for the last dram of the night.  Ardbeg Corryvreckin! As I get up to get the last dram I happen to see a couple of guys who are looking quite far into their drinks eying us, but think nothing of it. I go up and order my Corryvreckin and when I come back I see my wife, brother and sister in law looking VERY uncomfortable as the two guys I'd seen sitting next to my wife and talking to her. ""You look uncomfortable, maybe we can help with that."" I sit down next to my wife and put my arm around her waist. ""Hi guys, can we help you with anything?"" ""Christ he's a yank"" Great, this is going to go well. They continue talking. ""We were just noticing how your friend here is looking very uncomfortable"" they say as they point to my wife. ""Ahh my friends I think you'd be wrong about that, considering that she just told you she's fine"" I hand the glass of Corryvreckin to my wife after a brief nose. She noses it, trying to ignore the two guys, one sitting next to me now, and the other sitting next to her. They make a few cracks about Americans. This could go well or bad, so I decide to start making jokes. They comment that Americans are fat. I inform them that they're wrong. Aussies are fat, Americans roll down the street since their legs no longer support them. This causes everyone at the table to blink and laugh. ""You said that dude, not us."" ""I know! Do you know how you can tell an American apart from everyone else? They're the ones who needs the floors strengthened and the doors widened before they come into the building"" They start laughing harder and harder as I continue to crack jokes. They then look at the glass that my wife has handed back to me as I give it a nose. ""Man, we've been seeing you smell those glasses all night, you can't tell me that you're getting anything different from it. It all smells and tastes like Chivas. Now gin, gin is a mans drink."" I laugh at them real quick and inform them that you each whisky has it's own different odors and flavors. I nose the glass as I inform them of what ""gin drunks"" mean. I then start talking about what often goes into the distilling of gin and the way that it's done. I then start calling out flavors in the Corryvreckin as I hand it back to my wife. Nose: Definitely an Ardbeg with smoke and peat, but it's not so overpowering that nothing else shines, some phenol nuts, almost like rubbing alcohol, fruits mainly oranges, and seaweed notes come in through quite strongly. The guys look at me and laugh as my wife noses the glass and looks at me and suggests that she thinks she gets a little bit of cherries in it. The guy closest to me, the gin man, snorts and informs me that there is no way anyone could tear apart any drink like that and then hands me his drink and dares me to do just that. I nose his drink, not quite sure what all has gone into it, but the smell reminds me obviously of gin, but he has some mixers in there, specifically lime and cucumber and pretty darn sure soda water. So I start calling out flavors as I take a few small sips.  ""Citrus of some sort, I'm say lemon, because your lime is coming through too strong as part of your mixer, there is some juniper and a hint of ginger in it. I have a strong flavor of cucumber which is quite unpleasant, but my friend you've damaged your drink by having it watered down so much with all that ice which is killing alot of the flavor that is supposed to make gin a pleasure to drink."" The guy blinks at me, looks at his friend and we all hear what we've been waiting to hear  ""Come on, let's go"" We all look at one another quite relieved. This has caused a low point of the evening. We finally get to take a taste of the thing we're there for, the whisky! The flavors are awesome! Smoke, peat, seaweed, some spices, the citrus comes out strongly but not overpowering the whisky and a follow up of the medicinal notes. This is Ardbeg at it's finest!! And so well worth the wait. There is a definite alcohol kick. But not so much that it was unpleasant. The finish was long with the smoke, peat, seaweed and some pepper hanging onto my tongue.  Awesome Islay whisky! This retails for roughly $150 AUS when you can find it, but it's worth it! Now this was supposed to be the last whisky of the night, but as I go to pay the bill I see a new updated whisky menu as I'm paying and two things pop up. Ardbeg 1998 Renaissance and the glory of all glories: Ardbeg Lord of the Isles for $50 bucks a dram! I look over to my wife and make puppy dog eyes and being the awesome wife that she is, she nods. The night isn't over yet! Next on the block after MUCH palate cleansing will be Ardbeg 1998 Renaissance. Nose: thick peat and smoke upfront, black forrest fruits, pine tree sap, buttery, chilli, seaweed, slightly medicinal, campfire ash, oily olives, some plasters. Palate: Oily, Peat and Smoke hit, salt, chilli, dried orange peels, lemmon rind, fresh oysters (good ones) oils, tar, slightly medicinal, clove and other spice. Finish: Peat and smoke slowly taper out, chili, freshly ground oils from green olives, the peat is rich, distinct taste of fresh oysters again, grassy zestiness. This is just an Excellent whisky. In the endless debate on which ardbeg is better out of the oogy and the corry I prefer the corry by just a smidgen. Though they are both very different.  Nose: Smoke and peat, lots of fried bacon, stewed lemons, buttered toast, burning leaves, bandages, vanilla, maple syrup, cashews, salty cookie dough, road tar. Becomes more buttery and floral with water. Taste: Peat smoke, salted butter, overcooked bacon, lemon zest, rubber tires, olive oil, balsamic vinegar. Very oily. Finish: Billowing smoke, grilled anchovies, charred lemons, charred red peppers, and seaweed. If you like peaty whiskies, you'll be happy with this. I am always impressed at how Ardbeg comes across so well-mannered at high strengths. At 57.1%, it doesn't kick me in the teeth and make my eyes water like some high strength whiskies (not that those whiskies were bad - A'bunadh, I miss you so). Anyway, it's very good, but if I had my pick of Corryvreckan or Uigeadail, it's Uigeadail every time.  Light, light sun colour. Nose is minty and glue-like. Fresh fish and sea water (oyster-rific). Taste is rich and oily with lots of seaweed and iodine flavours. Finish is long and very tingly (it's a technical term). Nose: Pine, Leather, Dark Chocolate Taste: Pepper, Sea Salt, Medicinal Finish: Long and warm. Almost felt like heartburn. Smokey and Medicinal. Peaty at the end. Served neat at room temp. Pours a white grape juice color...a little darker than normal Ardbeg 10 year old but overall very light SRM for whiskey. A gentle swirl provides small legs and a thick top ring laced with thick beads. Nose is really outstanding. Yes, it is clearly smokey but it is not something that stands out as smoke. No char, no wood, no burnt character. Instead there is honey barbecue, sharp chamomile, small peaty iodine, bitter citrus, very intense nasal ""sting"" from so much spicy alcohol character. Let this one open up into such a fantastic nose: very soft smolder and old world tar, very intense honey, flowers, herbs. In the mouthfeel, small honey viscosity with immediate saltiness and sharp brine moving to sweet barbecued meat and fat. On the palate it is sharp, softer, mildly warming on the esophagus with long, lingering heat and spice. Very long finish piling on honey, tea herbs, and sweet barbecue. Incredible softness with no single character dominating. Smoke is obvious, but not the only thing going for this one. Really incredible. Totally different from the normal Ardbeg 10. I'm not sure one is necessarily better, this one is just softer and more complex.  The Corryvreckan is in our Islay tasting pack.  Tony says: ""I am a big fan of Ardbeg, especially the releases of whisky made under the new ownership. In my opinion this is a bit like the uigeadail, in that its a bit mental, but with the new cleaner style I prefer(i.e. without that dirty peatiness others love). My ranking of the recent releases (bearing in mind I love them all): Renaissance, Super Nova, Corryvreckan, rollercoaster.""  Dominic Tasting notes: ""Nose: Not a million miles away from the Kilchoman, successfully pulling off that very difficult feat of marrying fruity sweet wine notes with sharp, gristy and industrial Islay smoke. Palate: It bristles with intense Barolo or Rioja like red wine notes and intense acrid coal smoke. It's a brutal malt, brilliantly balanced but hard-edged and flinty. Quite stunning. Finish: Full and forever. It's been a while...but boy have I missed this!"" Pat's tasting notes: "" Nose: Immediate thwack of carroway seed, currants, salt, wood glue, beautifully integrated with the peatsmoke. Taste: Creamy and smoky, mouth-filling dark bitter chocolate. Late wood. Intensely drying."" Score is an aggregate of us all. On the nose this very gentle peat smoke, honey, custard creams, waft of smoked fish, lime cordial. (Don’t plunge your nose too far into this – it’s 57.1%, for heaven’s sake.) Each time I take a whiff of this, I find there’s something else going on in the glass. On the mouth, there are so many layered, intense flavours that just smack you right in the chops. There’s barley and treacle, brine and fire, citrus and pepper, a touch of oak and darkest bitter chocolate. This is mouthwatering stuff. That sweetness mixed with the smoke is so well balanced – in fact, if you want a text book example of a balanced single malt whisky, you need look no further. Afterwards: a sort of biscuity, meaty, peppery, chilli-infused tang. The alcohol is so intense – cask strength – that the taste lingers for ages, nestling into all those taste-buds. The second tasting a week or so later wasn’t quite as fine; in between this and the first, I sampled the Ardbeg Uigeadail, which really is breathtakingly good and which I must review soon. (Or perhaps it was the fiery food I consumed earlier.) That said, the Corryvreckan is a powerful, spicy and wonderfully balanced dram. Geek alert: I got into single malts about a year ago via an upscale lounge in NYC which sponsors free tastings on Saturdays. I nabbed a copy of a reputable whisky mag (well, it wasn't nabbing since it was offerred for free). It happened to have been the yearly review issue. This bottle was rated whisky of the year in that publication for 2009.  My relationship to smokiness in anything is one of an infatuated lover. In fact, my professed favorite smell that the earth can produce is a bonfire (preferably one with resinous wood for some reason). These things said....This bottle became my holy grail. I searched, but it was too late for me. All the stocks on the Northeast were sold out. I went as far as finding the original press release showing what retailers would have the bottle. Alas, I found one in the great state of massachusettes, a bit off the beaten path for me. no way in heck could I justify a sojourn to my wife just for whisky as a novice enthusiast. So I planted the seed. ""C-O-R-R-Y-V-R-E-C-K-A-N is how its spelled,"" I said when asked what I want for Xmas. Somehow, she managed to find someone in California willing to ship it to me in NY. I love my wife. Now down to business: Nose pre dilution: Bacon bacon bacon. Seaweed. Burnt dried fruit. Black fermented garlic cloves.  Nose post-dilution: Bacon bacon (fruit) bacon. Seaweed. Burnt dried fruit puree. I'll be honest, the aromas were just as strong, with a continuity that just has not been matched by anything else I've tried yet. This is a big Islay; not one that leads by injecting fear, but one who certainly asserts its authority. Its Michael Corleone in a bottle (sorry for the Godfather reference). In other words, its a young, powerful, unimaginably full of surprises and natural talent. There are bananas there, rum. This bottle is aptly titled. Hats off. Food pairing: Main: Surf and turf that involves seaweed and mushrooms, a vegetarian plate. Sure you can do a nice fatty NY strip, but why make the meat the star? Why not the whisky?  I only suggested a main, because I wouldn't think of making this an appetizer whisky. Too big, too complex (and also too expenseive!). My hats off to you Corry. You've put a smile on my face. Nose: lots of smoke, burnt rubber-tires, hazelnut, peat, earthy, tar, banana, parfume. Palate: Peat, bacon, smoke, citrus, dry and citrusy finish, with a sweet smoky twist. Huge mouth-feel. Rich and medium-full bodied...just continues to grow in the mouth. Colour: sunlight Body: thin legs, good body Nose: immediately a strong whiff of peat; tar, strong alcohol, bonfire smoke, burnt rubber, sweet notes after a while. Palate: stunning from the very beginning! Salty, smoky, sweet vanilla mixed with peat and seaweed, again tar and rubber. This is awesome! I've never thought about roasting some seafood plunged in vanilla on a grill, but this is the nearest thing that comes into my mind! One of the best palates I've ever tasted, this beats Uigeadail IMHO. Finish: dragon-like finish! I'm breathing out smoke and surely I have liquid fire in my mouth! I'm not going to brush my teeth tonight, I'm sure I will wake up with a peaty breath tomorrow! Overall: superbe whisky, worth every single cent! Kudos to Ardbeg! 97/100 P.S. I didn't dare to add water to this dram! Ardbeg doesn’t really need an introduction, so I’ll save myself the trouble. This Ardbeg Corryvreckan (NAS) has a beautiful gold color with a green sheen and a great viscosity. I am sampling the standard bottling from 2009, nog the Committee version. The Corryvreckan is named after the world’s second largest whirlpool, north of the island of Islay. It has matured on French winecasks. This one has a typical Ardbeg nose: powerful sweet peat, bitter orange marmalade, lime and even passion fruit in perfect balance with seaweed, oysters and smoke ham. The more patience you show, the more the sweet scents come out. But it is always in motion, making this a very interesting and complex nose.  Even when taking a careful sip, you’ll get a kick in the teeth from this aggressive dram. It starts of sweet, but soon pepper and smoke join in. Adding a little water won’t hurt. It pronounces the sweeter side of the whisky. This is truly a whirlpool of flavours. Liquorice, smoked ham, chocolade, seaweed, up and down, back and forth. And a pinch of seasalt to finish it off. Amazingly complex and invigorating. The finish is long and warming and honors the nose once more: the sweat peat and seaweed come back for an encore. This would make a perfect winter dram and is by far the best Ardbeg I’ve tasted so far! Smoky, sweet on the nose. The minute is enters your mouth the peat and sweetness envelope the tongue. After this the sea salt comes into play and the finish is long and vegetal. In the nose is vanilla, fruit and honey. And some subtle smoke.The taste is big and smooth, very nice, like the nose and at the same time reveals its true Ardbeg colours as vanilla, smoke and tar. The finish is rather long, as most Ardbegs do. So for me, this whisky is the best in 2008(and for a lot of others too, if I do remember well!  Nose has sweet wood smoke, brine, pipe tobacco, black raspberry, dark chocolate Tastes of wet stone at first, slowly opening up into a peppery, citrus, burnt raisin fireball, which erupts into a smoky, peppery maelstrom layered with subtle notes of black olive, chocolate, and burnt coffee. Shows incredible length and exhibits a bit more brine on its last, dying breath. Akin to sitting comfortably in a large castle that is on fire Summary: very complex, bold, expansive, balanced- best for a dark and stormy night Nose:Peat of course, undoubted peat, but not too strong. you can smell lots of Citrus notes here, mostly Oranges and kumquat, and hints of spice. definitely an Ardbegian nose in terms of lemons and citrus. love it! Palate: This is a really complex dram. It starts with a wham! , the alcohol bomb is released into the mouth. first you get the sweet tones, malty kind of, some burnt sugar. then, it changes into a more spicy,peppery, and smoky tones. very interesting indeed! Finish: on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it 11. it’s very long, smoky, the peat is there with you for so long.the ashes do not seem to go away, and the peat/spice/smoke lingers in your mouth for hours. they really do. Nose - Butter, creamy, Vanilla-rich, almost pine-resin freshness. Palate - Creamy. So incredibly creamy! Spice, Nutmeg, and a huge and overwhelming hit of Vanilla Ice-cream (it's slightly dirty Ice-cream though. Something you might get in a cheap choc-ice). Moves into Orange-peel and clementine. Finish - Salty, smoked meats make a big appearance. The peat is surprisingly fleeting amongst the other flavours. Astonishing. Simply astonishing. I'd wanted to have a rant about the price-point for a NAS whisky, but simply can't bring myself to. Worth every penny. distillery (ok, Head to head with Laphraoig which i also adore) is great news. The 10-year-old is indeed a cornerstone of any whisky lover’s home bar. my current Ardbeg favorite is the Uigeadail, which is my favorite dram right now (that changes with the season and mood), which is hard to beat. sherry and peat are a match made in heaven. When i first read about the release of the Corryvreckan , i just knew i was going to buy this baby, although it’s not a cheap malt, and costs more than the Beastie(Airigh Nam Beist) it replaces in Ardbeg’s line of products. i am going to do write a post about the soon to depart beastie, but it’s considered by some the best Ardbeg to date. i got the Corry on the morning, and didn't wait much to taste it, last night, and here are my notes: Ardbeg Corryvreckan 57,1%, OB 2009 color: Golden yellow. darker than i had expected Nose: Peat of course, undoubted peat, but not too strong. you can smell lots of Citrus notes here, mostly Oranges and kumquat, and hints of spice. definitely an Ardbegian nose in terms of lemons and citrus. love it! Palate; This is a really complex dram. It starts with a wham! , the alcohol bomb is released into the mouth. first you get the sweet tones, malty kind of, some burnt sugar. then, it changes into a more spicy,peppery, and smokey tones. very interesting indeed! Finish: on a scale of 1 to 10, i’d give it 11. it’s very long, smokey, the peat is there with you for so long.the ashes do not seem to go away, and the peat/spice/smoke lingers in your mouth for hours. they really do. on an interesting note, i put the empty glass in the sink, and went to sleep. in the morning, when i woke up and went near the sink, i could smell the wonderful smell of peat smoke, still in the glass. after more than 8 hours!!! To sum up: this is one of the best Ardbegs i have sampled so far. with it’s Cask stength and complexity, it’s well worth the price. i would put it one notch below the Uigeadail which is my favorite. but if you are an Ardbeg fan, or an Islay Peat-head, this is definitely a must dram got to have handy. i am waiting for the cold winter nights, to drink a wee dram of this, and get warm all over Nose of Islay together with dark chocolate, a touch of coffee and some red berries. First a lot of chocolate and coffee, pepper, then Islay, but smooth and a little bit more in the background. Water will kill the chocolate and underlines the smooth Islay character. Nose: peat smoke mixed with lemons, fresh kumquats but also slightly overdue oranges. Walnuts and wet wool. A few grassy notes and hints of heavily toasted bread. Coffee and a few spicy notes emerge after a while (pepper and ginger). I even picked up hints of violet candy which is quite remarkable. They were gone quickly, but it proves the Corryvreckan is indeed a real whirlpool of flavours. Mouth: very strong impact, starting rather sweet but evolving towards a spicy / savoury profile. Peppery with generous coal smoke. Lemon again, liquorice, phenols, very Ardbeggy. Toast with peach jam. Some cocoa. Finish: very long, continuously switching between peat, salt, mocha and pepper. Hints of olive juice."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,46,Ardbeg 1990 Airigh Nam BeistOB,"Nose: First up is wet moss with ocean misting over you. A bag of salted pretzels opens up, plus some toasty caramel syrup and traditionally glazed donuts. Whole toasted coriander lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle as well as some dried lavender and the bright citrusy pop of spruce tips pop off like a laser light show. The nose alone is thrilling theater. Taste: Peat so soft and lovely you could nap on it. Soft caramel chews, but the very expensive sort from France which has a complex quality (hard to describe!). There’s a character of malt here that feels mystical. I want to keep this flavor memory forever. Vanilla bean paste is here as well as the most luxurious sugar cookie you’ll ever eat. This whisky is extraordinarily earthy and elemental.  Finish: An Islay finish if there ever was one, but mature and sure of itself in the way that charms you completely. This Ardbegian dram is very nearly perfect, aside from an underwhelming ABV. I sipped a glass yesterday while I supped, and scribbled down some tasting notes on a napkin upon a rather splintery picnic table.  Since The Beast is so hard to come by these days, I treasured the moment as a ""second coming"" of Ardbeg's miraculous nectar into my life. Let's hope it's not the last. Nose: Charcoal, creamery butter, calk dust, BBQ chicken, sage. Palate: Lovely peat presence, Allspice, dark chocolate, Orange Crush, woodstove fire smoke and creosote, hint of the sea. Finish: Turkey jerky, BBQ potato chips, fading peat, smelling salts, sea salt, vanilla bean, chickory.  ""The Second Coming"" Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? Above poem by Ireland's wwn William Butler Yeats: Notorious member of The Golden Dawn Occult Society, who, no doubt, was not thinking of the Baby Jesus or the Messiah's triumphant return to earth when he penned the above poem.  Let's face it: Ardbeg's Beast is no angel, despite all of the talk of ""angel's shares"" in the industry among distillers. Then again, Old Testament angels weren't partial to playing softball or strumming on harps with their flaming swords and bolts of fire. Still, I tend to think of whisky as Old Bendy's provenance. 1974, indeed.  This is a bottle I opened on 10/10/2008. This was the first release of the Airigh Nam Beist from 2006 (so the sixteen year old version) made from a mixture of first and second fill ex-bourbon casks (no sherry here!) When I tasted it the bottle had been open for 3 years and then decanted into a smaller bottle. I tasted it next to the Ardbeg 1977 and the 17 year old. Nose: Very delicate peat on a very complex bed of flavors. This easily seems like the most dense nose of the night where the 17 is the lightest. There is a beautiful smoky peat here that is both old and rich. There are orchids here . . . there are some thick velvety notes with hints of cinnamon, all spice, brown sugar, caramel, nutmeg, and cloves. There is an elusive sweetness that is just out of reach of the minds eye. It hints at sweet and hints at dry, but it doesn’t seem to be either. If the 17yo is Ardbeg at its most appealing, then this is Ardbeg at its most seductive. That peat is just so damn sexy. It is a peat fire in an old dark woods where the trees are so close together that light doesn’t shine on the forest floor. You are drawn to it like a moth to the flame all the while knowing that things in these woods could devour you whole. There are also some iodine and strong maritime notes from the ocean: seaweed, sea salt coated rocks, and sea soaked drift wood. Now the sweet bourbon almost makes an appearance . . . but then jumps out of frame before the camera can focus. OH YAH . . . once you dial in on the bourbon (this is a mixture of first and second fill “bourbon” casks from Jack Daniels – I know “not bourbon”) you can really pick up on that influence. Just about one of the best Ardbeg noses ever! A top 5 “all time” whisky nose for me. Water actually releases some of the Beist within. It just becomes more muscled peat and smoke. Taste: Sweet arrival with velvet cake, dates, plumbs, vanilla, oak, and peat. There is also an interesting note or two that are reminiscent of the 77 where you have hints of pine and diesel oil. Finish: There is that intake of breath with some green pine notes . . . and then an assault of sea salt and iodine. It is a slow building of smoke, peat, herbal, and citrus. It carries along pine, smoke, mint, eucalyptus, and mango while still leaving a trail of salt and soft peat embers. A very nice and sophisticated Ardbeg. This is a medium finish as well as the 17 . . . while not being as impressive as the 1977 . . . Complexity, Balance: Certainly one of the most complex and well balanced Ardbegs I have tasted. There is such an amazing balance from the peat, smoke, fruit, sweet, and dry flavors. That power, depth, and complexity extend over the entire span of this malt – nose to finish. Hard to fault it  Aesthetic experience Light gold . . . possibly a shade darker then the 17yo and the 77. Medium to medium full bodied. First, I have to say I love Ardbeg. Second, I love the name. However, I wish they would have used the name for a real “Beist” of a dram (like the Corry or the Supernova). It is odd that neither the Beist nor the Alligator are as ferocious as their names lead you to believe – they are in fact rather tame Ardbegs. Back to the bottle: Love the NCF while the 46% is just ok. 48% would be better and anything between 50-58% would be amazing. Then again it wouldn’t be the same dram. Love the vintage idea, but why would Ardbeg consider this being a standard release? There was no way to keep it up for long . . . However, I love the sophisticated feel of this dram. Hope the new 17 or 18 year old is like it. But, I hate the label with the name breaking out of the boarder. So huge points with a few taken away for persnickety reasons. Conclusion: Hands down better then the 17 year old. I really can’t love this nose any more. Truly fantastic. But I don’t love the taste and the finish . . . they leave me wanting. Maybe it needed to be at Cask Strength . . . or maybe that is just me . . . Either way, this just had too little power for my taste. Comparing this to the 1977 the ’77 wins on taste. This catches back up based on the fact that you can still find this guy on shelves . . . if you look hard enough. I have passed on buying more of these bottles for $100 on several occasions. I think I paid $120 for this bottle over 6 years ago in Seattle . . . for my money the lack of power doesn’t make up for the wonderful nose. I now have only one 50mL sample left from my original bottle . . . I can nose that for ages.  I won't bother with tasting notes, since very few people can secure a bottle of The Beast.  Here are my impressions of the last glass I tasted (about two weeks ago): Nose utterly fantastical and nearly otherworldly. I couldn't stop myself from nosing it, inhaling almost as if I were ""huffing"" some sort of illegal drug. There is a deeper, tar-like perfection, that transcends most of the Islays I have ever tasted. Truly one of a kind and magical. Palate: I coated my tongue and luxuriated in this dram. No water added to the glass, but I did occasionally take a sip of water, wring and swallow all the liquid from my mouth, and then sip the dram with ""refreshed"" mouth tissues. For me, this technique often is superior to adding water to a quality dram. At 46%, the Beast needs no h20. It is nice with a lightly hydrated mouth, or a neutral mouth that has not recently sipped water. Finish: Heavenly, absolutely divine. An immortal match forged in the fiery coke ovens of hell and then rocketed skyward to tempt the angels with its blasphemous ""share."" What a treat it is to sip a glass of Beast!  NOTE TO ARDBEG: Ye yon bright sparks hath never even come nigh to repeating the Magick That Is All Things Beisty.  Suggestion: Now here is a whisky that would stun the shite out of me, and many other connosrs: An offering very close in composition to the Beast with a higher ABV, say up round 51-54%, along with a touch of older casks to round out depth of character. If you don't have the older backstock at Ardbeg any longer then consider acquiring some older suitably matched whisky (17-21 years or so) from another distiller on Isla or in the north. Marry this older acquisition with a fiery young upstart Ardbeg with a profile similar to The Beast.  The borrowed older whiskies need only be a small percentage of the blend; just enough to add a little depth & delight to the marriage. There is no shame in using a wee bit of another distillery's older stock if your warehouses simply don't have the older stuff. Your fans would be delighted that you went to the trouble. And if you do have the older stuff, what better way to use it than to create a strong relation to The Beast.  Time to open another bottle of something peaty, something Ardbeg. This one is bottled 2007, so it is 17YO. The last bottle I had was also a 2007 so I do not know how this compares to the 2006 or 2008 bottlings. Salty vanilla and poached pears absolutely fill the nose. Nougat and honey coat the mouth. A real sweetie. Let's give it a swish. At 46%, the burn is noticeable and nicely numbing. Getting some faint burnt marshmallow on the finish, which could be longer, but is entirely sweet and pleasant. I like this a lot. It is not as aggressive as the 10 and the Corry, which are frankly, a bit more than I can handle. This is an expensive bottle. It is going to cost me $130 to replace this, but I like it so much that I am going to. My local whisky haunt just revised and expanded on a menu that was severely outdated and as it turns out, an Ardbeg that was previously listed as simply ""Ardbeg 1990"" turns out to actually be the Airigh Nam Beist--a malt that I've been hoping to find since I tried my first Uigeadail. And all the while... it's been right here unbeknownst to me. There was only a little bit remaining, and needless to say I stuck around to finish the final three drams of what is most likely the last bottle they have. :) And quite possibly the only one I'll try. I figured a review was in order. Nose: Pretty understated nose on this. Some mild leather, a substantial sherry presence, hints of creamy toffee and milk chocolate and a touch of very sweet pipe tobacco. Taste: I'm getting a lot of creamy milk chocolate with a mild mannered peat infusion. Imagining what brownies baked on Islay might taste like. Graceful development. Later in the development a heat builds and the creamy chocolate takes on more of a chilli chocolate character with the sweet tobacco and leather coming back near the end. Finish: Sugar cane, cream, leather and cinnamon. A fleeting hint of dark cherry--perhaps black forrest cake. And under all of that a faint pipe tobacco note that carries on and on and on... Airigh Nam Beist... it was a pleasure to finally meet you. Airigh Nam Beist was first sold in 2006 and was bottled over two more subsequent years. Its name is Gaelic for “shelter of the beast"". This review refers to the 2007 release, a 17-year old whisky matured mostly in ex-Bourbon casks. The nose delivers a powerful impact: it is intense with tar, salt, brine and coal ash. As was to be expected there also is a lot of smoke but rather decent and soft. With water the smoke becomes even lighter while vanilla and lemon notes appear as well as a malty sweetness. I must say that this is a great nose, smoky on the one hand but with a sweet and fruity element on the other hand. The palate is medium-bodied and smooth but quite spicy. There is less smoke than what the nose suggested, more like a bonfire smokiness, soft and subdued. At the end I detected coffee and chocolate. The finish is quite long and warming. The smoke is now much more pronounced. With water the smoke becomes more subdued and oily like smoked salmon. I loved this Ardbeg. It has the intensity that I would expect from an older release but at the same time it surprised with its malty sweetness and perfect balance. Too bad that this has now become rare. The Airigh Nam Beist hit the shelves for the first time in 2006. It is Gaelic for ‘Shelter of the Beast’, pronounced ‘arri nam baisht’ and named after the second lake south of Uigeadail (another tongue twister). In 2007 and 2008 new batches were released of this originally 16 Year Old whisky. I get sweet, delicate peat, seaweeds and iondine (but less than expected) on the nose, followed instantly by fruit in the guise of lemon, peach and Granny Smith apples. A little farmy too. Dried flowers and hay. Not really a stable scent, but close enough. I imagine myself it is the scent of the Beast’s lair. The first thing I notice, when the whisky carresses the tongue, is the generous creaminess. Caffé Latte. Followed immediately by salt and pepper and a whole lot of citrus (but less than on the nose). The peat is less delicate here, as if it has had enough of sulking in the corner. A slice of smoked ham (from the Beast?) and a lot of liquorice. Very, very nice. The finish, on liquorice and sea salt, is wonderfully long. The nose was okay, but on the palate, it is a stellar whisky. Ardbeg enjoys cult status. The big downside is the fact that bottles increase in price faster than you can imagine. This was originally sold for around 70 EUR, but today you will have to fork over (even for the newer batches) double that amount. Nose: soft thick peat, toffee, orange peel, coals, sea saltiness, soft wood Palate: Very creamy, salty tang, Ardbegs standard Omnipresent smoke and peat but soft, dried green apple, toffee, buttermilk, cream, sweet vinilla, cereal grains, some nuts (walnuts, almonds) Finish: Smooth and soft smoke and peat yet very creamy, slight vinilla sweetness, sprinkle of salt. Note: The bottle I have is of the 2006 batch.  I'm very happy and glad that I finally own a bottle of this fantastic Beast from the legendary Ardbeg, the Airigh Nam Beist 1990-2008. It is quite hard to find but thank God I bought this great dram from a great and fantastic whisky store here in the Netherlands for 115 euro, every penny worth it! For all Ardbeg's actually, are every penny worth it. Here my review of this wonderful delicate dram. Nose: Very nice smooth, citrus like lemon and grapefruit, lightly peated and smoked also some oily elements of nuts, savoury as well. Taste: In one word: Fantastic!! Delicate, smooth. Fine smooth peat, lighty balanced with great chocolate and raisins. Lemony, and also a bit sweetness with a hint of coffee and mint. Finish: Long, fades slowly away with chocolate, caramel and coffee with the great Ardbeg peat behind. One thing is for sure, this piece of Art of the maqnificent Beast of Ardbeg is a perfect whisky! 750mL scored at a hole in a wall in Maryland for $130 a bottle. Alright, sounds good to me seeing that DC bottle shops will try to dupe you into paying $250 for a bottle of Supernova and $150 for a bottle of Corryvreckan.  The Beast pours super pale straw with beads forming quickly with a swirl and thin, delicate legs. Nose is more Highland than I was expecting with spiced golden pears, muted bacon fat, yellow apple pie, lightly smoky wood. Fresher, inviting nose. No intense peat or near formaldehyde smell that can sometimes come through with Islay scotch. Taste is oily and very nutty with huge macadamia nut and Brasil nut fat and bitter husk.  Finish is quick, small esophagus heat, leaving a trail of roasted nuts and fatty oil. Very delicate and lovable with no real smoke or peat presence. Very muted saltwater brine and char. I would say if you are a Highland fan and scared of Islay, this may be a nice compromise.  I will say that my relationship with Ardbeg started me off in love with Corryvreckan and not a big fan of the Uigeagail. Now I find myself sometimes wanting Corryvreckan and always wanting the Uigeagail. The latter is meaty and spicy and hugely satisfying with a lot of body and presence. The 1990 is so soft and pear heavy it's tough to say it is better than the Uigeagail, which I'm starting to think is actually the best Ardbeg and therefore the best Scotch in the world.  Bring it back... please don't take this one away from us!!! Out of all the Ardbegs in the range, this has been my favorite so far, because of the nuances of character that I haven't quite found anywhere else. Don't get me wrong, I am a diehard Ardbeg fan and like pretty much everything in the range no matter what many critics say about popularity ruining the consistency, but this one was just something special for me. Pricey little bottle, but worth every penny. Notes of cream, ice cream, and vanilla emerge from the peat to wrap the intense phenols on the nose in a delicious soft shell. The vanilla notes emerge again on the palate, coming out a good while after the peat has coated the tongue, melts away into a smoothness that is unlike anything I've had before in an Islay malt. Truly one of a kind. I've compared this to an Ardbeg milkshake and will probably cry on the day that this bottle is empty. I have previously reviewed this (connosr.com/reviews/ardbeg/…), but when my wife bought me a bottle I noticed it was significantly different than I remembered and from my notes, so I thought a re-review was in order. So some info - the Beast was distilled in 1990 and was bottled in three batches - in 2006, 2007 and 2008. I don't know what year my previous Beast was bottled at, but this one is the 2008 bottling. It's pale so it looks to me like it was probably exclusively or mostly aged in ex-bourbon barrels and it's pretty unlikely to have had any caramel added - but take that with a grain of salt, I don't know for certain, but that's what it looks like to me! The nose is rich, full of velvety peat with salty highlights over a toffee apple sweetness. Gentle smoke is there as an undertone - but it's a bit greasy, like from a properly fired up barbeque with maybe a hint of good tobacco smoke. There's some iodine in the background and a hint of citrous as well. Really intriguing and keeps modulating, with it being slightly different every time! The taste is creamy but surprisingly light. Initially full of peat, smoke and brine, it quickly and gently gives way to vanilla and citrous (maybe pineapple?), some mint and hints of good olive oil. Dangerously easy to drink, and very moreish. The finish is moderately long and gently warm, full of citrous, olives and a peppery saltiness come to the fore and are tucked to bed by a nice warm peat and barbeque smoke blanket. This is genuinely excellent, and really drinkable. The finish isn't short (not even close), but I find myself wanting to get back to this much quicker than a lot of other drams. Bit expensive (and far too hard to find nowadays) to be a session whisky... ;) Just goes to show the difference different batches/bottlings can make. This is a 1990 vintage limited edition from Ardbeg. There were three releases 2006, 2007 and 2008. Mine is 2008, so 18 years old. Nose: Typical peat from Ardbeg, but with something special. Vanilla ice cream. It is peated vanilla ice cream. Strange, but interesting. There is a bit of citrus on the background also Mouth: Typical Ardbeg peat with campfire smoke. The vanilla ice cream is still there, which makes it very good. It is different from all the other Ardbegs I have tried. It is like a Ardbeg that has been made for women but men has the right to like it also. Finale: Very long, it is 18 years old after all. The campfire smoke stays in the mouth for a half eternity.  The whisky is very good. It is a peated Ardbeg like always but with a feminine touch that makes it very unique. I drop a tear each time a take a dram and sees the bottle go down as it is sold out everywhere !!! I should have bought a case. At a recent ""tasting event"" among some web designer friends, I was able to sample this lovely bottle of Scotch. (visual proof here bit.ly/fhBO0k ) I liked it so much, I went out a purchased a bottle for my collection. To convince you to do the same, I will now describe my initial tasting experience... First, the nose: ""oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh"" Then, the taste: ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"" And finally, the finish: ""aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh"" For a review that uses words like ""carmel, vanilla, smoke and smooth,"" please refer to the other reviews. And for goodness sake, get yourself a bottle of Nam Beist before they're all gone! The Airigh Nam Beist is a vintage release, originally distilled in 1990 and bottled over three subsequent years: 2006, 2007, and 2008. The 2008 release is the subject of this review. In my review of the Ardbeg 10 year-old, I suggested that the TEN is a “benchmark peated malt Scotch whisky.” In tasting the Airigh Nam Beist, the TEN’s older and increasingly more difficult to find sibling, it seemed only natural that I used the TEN for the sake of comparison. The nose is reminiscent of dry barbecue smoke, brine, pepper, and anise. There are also occasional notes of vanilla, marshmallow, apples, sulfur, and grass. In comparison to the TEN, the Airigh Nam Beist is a slightly more visceral and sweeter experience, and the anise is a touch more prominent. On the palate, I find wood smoke, menthol, lime, brine, and black pepper. Fleeting hints of green apples, caramel, and reminders of the ex-bourbon barrel it was aged in arrive. It tastes a touch more mature than the TEN, though perhaps less spritely for it.  On the whole, I give the edge to the Airigh Nam Beist. I find it ever so slightly more refined and deliberate than the TEN, and exquisitely well crafted. Find a bottle before they're all gone. On the nose: mild smoke, sherry, very creamy, treacle sponge, a waft of ginger. Doesn’t come with the heft of smoke one expects from an Ardbeg, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  In the mouth: I was bamboozled at first. There are some sophisticated things going on. Creamy, mouthwatering peppery spice, then a sweetness, caramel, vanilla, then a tinge of brine. It’s lovely and oily, just sits in your mouth and on the taste buds. There’s a deeply pleasing after-taste of sweet, gentle smoke and barley. This is a dessert Ardbeg. Absolute bliss. The bottle lists this whisky as distilled in 1990 and bottled in 2008  Nose: Moderate peat, some medicinal smell, grapes, lemon, melissa balm, hysop, carnation Taste: wine flavour, peat, lemon, melissa, salt. The flavours are more robust in the mouth than in the nose, and form a nice coherent package Finish: long, but quickly becoming very gentle Balance: the flavours gel together nicely in this whisky. Some of the herbal and floral elements here seem quite distinctive to my palate. This is an excellent whisky to sip while sitting back and contemplating the meaning of life  To me, the nose on this beats out Uigeadail; it's phenomenal. When this stuff fills your mouth...oh my gosh it's amazing. The peat smoke is tamed by lucious white chocolate, marshmallow, and sweet barley. The peat comes back a little bit after, then the salt, then the fresh vegetal finish. This isn't just my favorite Ardbeg, it's my favorite scotch so far (and I should buy another bottle--while I can--and keep it hidden for awhile). The name, to some, implies a giant, bold scotch. This isn't. It's a very welcome surpise; an elegant desert scotch from Islay. I would have love to have tasted this at cask strength. NOTE: Don't add too much water to this one. Bottle signed by Davinia, known to be reminiscent of ice cream. Drammed from Glencairn glass. N: Much more subtle on the peat and medicinal aromas than most of the other Ardbeg offerings. Slight sweet caramel and toffee, little oak, slight creamy aroma. Light peat and fresh dirt from a potato. Water really cuts down on most of the aromas but brings out a touch of fruit.  T: Semi hot to start, some nice peat comes out first, smokey and a little iodine but not too heavy. A little sweet caramel and some creamy flavors build, which gives it that ice cream like flavor. A little chewy malt flavor as well. Water cuts down the heat, obviously, but also seems to bring out the peat more, but its accompanied by some chocolate and more sweet caramel. M: Medium body, rolls around the tongue smoothly. A little oily. F: Finishes a little more smokey, hot with warming alcohol, and a slight left over syrup on the mouth.  After galg's review of the Airigh Nam Beist the other day, I though while I was heading down to 'The Lark' to taste their wares, I would also see if they had a bottle lying around (they have a pretty big whisky collection on the shelves), and buy a glass. They did, so here were my notes: The nose is warm, peaty and smoky, with notes of sea salt and a subtle maltiness. Not a very complex nose, but pleasant enough. The taste is light, which is slightly surprising for a peaty smoky Islay malt. Once again there are sea salt notes, and after a second some caramel comes through as well. While all the elements of a good Islay dram are there, this seems just slightly disappointing. The finish is long, smooth, with the smoke and peat slowly warming over the top of the caramel sweetness. It's a fine dram, but it's like they took the formula for an Islay malt and reproduced it perfectly, but missed the key ingredient - character. All Islay malts are distinctive, and this feels like it is trying to blend into the background. Just like how hollywood take a style of movie, then make it formulaic, thereby killing off half the fun. So, it's not on my wish-list, but certainly not bad by any means. It probably should be an 8.5, but it lost a half point because Ardbeg's should be better. I am a big fan of the Ardbegs as you all know. the 10, ugedail and Corry are among my top 10. i was meaning to taste the beastie for a long time, and had the opportunity to do it only last night, in a comparative tasting against the Corry. i was very surprised by the malt profile... Nose: Much lighter and fruitier than i had imagined it to be. it reminded me of some Bruichladdichs, more than the usual Ardbegian zesty peaty stuff. Peat is there, but not as much as in the nose (as in the 10, corry). some vanilla, flowery heather notes?? (arbeg?!?!) quite feminine.  Palate: Smoke is felt immediately, peat touches the tongue, but not major amounts of it. it's definitely less fruity and floral than the nose. which is a nice twist. also, some salty notes. Finish: one of the shorter Ardbeg finishes around. smoke is felt, and also the maltiness, but not for very long. i would say that this malt would gain a lot of points if it were bottled at cask strngth like its successor the Corryvreckan. i felt it was a bit shy. i love my Ardbegs hot, spicy and peaty. I know many poeople think of this malt as the best ardbeg around, but i beg to differ. it's a great malt, but not on my fav list. if we talk in points, 85. The greatest Ardbeg I have ever tasted. But it is actually more then the typical Ardbeg! Suddenly there is a comfortable aftertaste. You sit around enjoying it without the constant urge to have another sip of your glass right away..."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,51.2,Ardbeg AlligatorOB,"My taste in Scotch tends to run to the Islays. But I generally shy away feom these “big” whiskies in the summer. 
I find the scent and taste of them lend them to winter drinking.  The initial nose is one of peat, iodine, smoke and wood. A little mint creeps in at the end.  On first sip, for a 50%+ ABV whisky, there is surprisingly little alcohol burn. It gives a full and complete mouthfeel that is almost sensory overload. 
There are quite a few flavors here - wood, oak, leather, char, iodine and an enveloping warmth that sort of defies explanation. It is not as heavy and “briny” as Laphroaig. There is also some outlying flavor of mint and menthol. 
The mid-palate reveals some banana and pineapple (surprisingly), with caramel/toffee and espresso added in.
The aftertaste is similar to the initial flavor, with a slight mineral/flint finish. It is long and lingering, and the peat remains in the mouth for quite some time, with the toffee taste as a companion. One has a sense of having eaten some deeply roasted espresso beans.  Ardbeg is a dram to be savored and experienced several times. It is not a whisky that is one dimensional by any means. 
A drop or two of water can expand the pallette of flavors even further. 
Alligator is a nearly perfect example of an Islay.  This is, in my opinion, the last of the good special release Ardbegs. I haven't cared much for the stuff that came after like the Day, Galileo and the AuriVerdes - though I quite liked the Ardbog for some reason. Unashamed in it's approach it is brash and hard hitting but if you look close enough has a gentler, softer side to it as well.  The spirit is essentially the standard 10 year old but finished in heavily charred barrels to give it a stronger smokier (barbeque) flavor. These new barrels were charred so much that they started cracking on the inside and began to resemble alligator skin.  Or as some intern in their marketing department likes to call it, Islay-Gator.  (I will pause now for you to softly facepalm yourself)  Moving on... I tasted the 'Gator when it came out and remember being blown away by it. It was actually one of the first Ardbegs I had ever tried (yes, I'm very new to whisky!) and, boy, am I glad it was this smokey monster! These notes are from a brand new bottle. Nose: Lots of ash with a sharp citrus drizzle on top. Butterscotch on barbequed sausage. I like how the smokey sweets play in tandem and don't let one overpower. The peat rolls in next on a bed of faint white flowers but what surprised me a touch was the red candy/licorice which added that touch of exotic. Wonderfully balanced nose. Palate: The citrus on the nose turns into a lovely bitter marmalade spread. There is peaty ash with a generous green chilli and black peppercorn garnish. The delivery is quite creamy and has hints of mint sprig. Finish: Long with that same exotic red licorice and spicy oranges. This is a glorious dram and deserves the reputation it has garnered. I've been saving my notes from a glass of Alligator that I savored a few months ago at the Highland Stillhouse. Here they are:  Nose: Charbroiled T-bone steak, creamy vanilla, lemon zest, Texas-style BBQ sauce, Anaheim (flame roasted) peppers, fruit compote, prunes, burnt butter brickle. Palate: More lemon (fruit), ginger scones, challah toast, cinnamon, back bacon, vanilla meringue, Key lime pie, graham cracker, sea salt, generous wafts of sweet smoke, and a deep satisfying peat that is unique to Ardbeg. Finish: Chicory, burnt challah, lovely rich peat, ocean brine, creosote pylons (as in an ocean wharf's), campfire coals hissing with delight. This Ardbeg earned its name from the heavily charred casks that resembled the scaly skin of alligators in which this whisky was aged.  See my link to a review (below in the comments section) with Mick Secor, owner (publican) of the Highland Stillhouse in Oregon City.  Mick was instrumental in getting Ardbeg back into the USA in general, and into Oregon in particular, many years ago, when single malts were few and far between in these parts. He is a retired heart surgeon who just happens to own and operate one of the very best pubs in America, which is dearly loved by Jim Murray and many other whisky greats.  Mick the Publican is a wealth of knowledge about whiskies--especially those which hail from Islay.  The chat (below) with him is worth hearing. I, for one, learned a great deal shooting the breeze with Mick on the top floor of his creaky old pub (which is haunted, by the way). The Stillhouse perches atop a rocky craig of basalt overlooking the Willamette river.  I've been known to sit out on the wooden deck, sipping a mind-blowing scotch whilst gazing out over the cliff, far far below .. . where ancient falls, once tamed by dams, have begun to reclaim their former glory, inch by inch, in the shadow of Lovecraftian-style derelict warehouses and mills.  Aye, these tin-roofed monstrosities of concrete sag a bit more with every passing year, crumbling into Willamette's stigeon depths, where vast schools of sturgeon amass, lumbering, en masse, like Cthulhu, himself, across aeolean abyss that might well ebb and flow into another dimension for all I know . . . or is this ode merely the ""living waters"" talking? Anything is possible, for I have dined on honey dew and drunk the milk of paradise, come rain or shine, from atop the black cliffs of Mick's eldritch haunt, o're looking Mother Nature's proxy & industry's loss far far below. . . . The Ardbeg Alligator was the first whisky I rated as expensive that I bought. It was a few years back a couple of weeks before Christmas, when, in a busy store, my friend and I probably looked too young to be taken seriously as whisky drinkers. I had a taste however and went home with a bottle (haven’t shopped there since, though…) And now, a semester is over, which calls for a celebratory dram. Also, I feel an illness of the throat coming on (no, I’m not learning Dutch), so I thought I’d send down the Alligator to kill whatever is trying to kill me.  Nose: First impression is peat on a bonfire. Phew, this is good stuff. Freshly ground coffee beans are sprinkled over a savoury barbecue sauce and seaweed with fresh citrus and lemongrass complete the dish (doesn’t really sound appetising in my opinion, but the folks at Ardbeg are a silly bunch). Mint leaves and candy slowly creep out from the background with touches of heather, and a crisp, fresh green apple mixed with sweet pear punctuates the whole ordeal. An interesting little side note here: Many Islay distilleries (Ardbeg more than most) pride themselves on high levels of phenols in their whiskies, as this relates to how peaty the whisky is. But did you know that the phenol primarily responsible for the peaty smell / taste is a compound called guaiacol? What’s more interesting, this phenol is derived from hydrolysis (basically a type of molecular breakdown, if you’re not chemistry savvy) of lignin, an integral part of plant cell walls. As such, guaiacol is also found in things like wood smoke and (and this is my favourite part) roasted coffee! Did you ever wonder, why your peated whisky had those delicious coffee notes? Anyway, so much for a ‘little’ side note. Palate: What can this little beast do? As you drink it in, you’re walking along the water in the bog, tasting the sweet peaty water – there’s no alligator here! But wait- what’s that? And snap! it emerges from the water and bites you without as much as a by your leave before you have time to call out “mum!” Alligators in a temperate climate!? Chewy, spicy, smoky and savoury, this is to be treasured. After a short while, sweetness prevails over spice, and the apple and pear of the nose truly shine, now mixed with juicy peaches, and – what’s that? Coffee? Could it be? Finish: The sweetness persists for a surprising amount of time into the finish. It’s like a tarte tatin prepared on the grill. Delicious fruit and soot. The alligator (as any new expression of Ardbeg) has sparked many different opinions across the web. Some hate it, some love it. I place myself in the latter category.  This is my second review, and also my second review of an Ardbeg. If I told you there would be no more of these, I would be lying, but I promise to renew myself at some point. At some point. But for now: This is smart stuff. Ardbeg Alligator was a Committee Release, and then a limited general release in 2011. The whisky was matured in heavily charred, viz. ""Alligator Char"" NEW oak barrels. The reviewed sample is compliments of @Nock  Nose: this differs from other Ardbegs in having a very sharp up-front greeting of smoke FUSED with wood sugar. That's one of the things which new charred oak will do, give you a lot of wood sugar. I really like it. Otherwise the Ardbeg house style of strong smoke, strong peat, strong brine, and maybe just a hint of fruit applies here Taste: Huge flavours! very rich tasting with very sharp pointed flavours of peat, smoke, brine, barley, and charred oak; very engaging and very intense in a style similar to Corryvreckan,...but, the harmony of these flavours together is good, but not great Finish: long finish with plenty of flavour, unfortunately this goes strongly to the sour by the end Balance: Ardbeg Alligator has big big interesting flavours, but is not one of the more balanced releases by Ardbeg. I found myself enjoying individual flavours and features of Alligator and not the whisky as a coherent whole. I passed up buying a bottle of Alligator when I had the opportunity, and I am not sorry that I did. This Alligator is a very vivid and interesting whisky, but I consider it to be one of the lesser Ardbegs  Tasted the Alligator for the first time last night. Gentle smoke, peat, graham cracker pie crust, clotted cream, toffee. No detailed tasting notes since it is unobtanium at this point.  I also enjoyed glasses of Balvenie Tun 1401 Batch Three, Yoichi 15, Campbeltown Loch 25, and Glen Elgin 16.  Feeling a bit under the weather today. Fun time though last night, and yes, about approx. 30% of the above ended up in my friends' mouths. Augh. That didn't sound right. I shared the glasses, and yes, I did try to keep my side of the glasses turned and I made a mental note of where the glass rim was still clean. Actually, I must confess that I'm something of a germaphobe, but I'm trying to overcome the aversion. Be this as it may, I've never been a miser. Maybe a red-headed bastard stepchild, but never a miser. Word had it this one was a winner and word was correct. And now, it is all gone. Goodbye sweet Ardie, goodbye. Perhaps we shall meet again in a better world. Ralf the Mouth never sang thy praises, but alas it should have.  In the meantime, there's always . . . the Mouth of Sauron?  www.youtube.com/watch Nose: Briny leather strikes you at first pour; rubbery kind of peat that eventually fades to that lemon pudding impression. Behind this arrives a fresh garden rhubarb, or the bitter skin of a fruit. Then you realize this fruit is stewing into a compote, mulling along with smooth sweetness of orange peels and some cinnamon and ginger. A continued waft can pull out salty toffee or butterscotch.  Palate: Immediate attack of pepper-brine-leather... turning tangy (bittermelon)... noticeably collapsing to tobacco-vanilla mellowness... and this finally followed by subtleties: first liquorice, then pepper. Finish: Long, with the pepper fading into vanilla & nut, the nut with a hinted bitterness found in almonds or apricot pits. The peat adds some tobacco to this, and then there is a sensation, not like barbecue sauce but like I have just eaten some a minute ago. I think many would wonder how this contrasts with the Uigeadail; it is clear from most descriptions that both are smoky, fruity, and spicy. Compared to Uigeadail, the Alligator is more challenging: relatively less sweet and more bitter; less vanilla softness and more toffee saltiness; less red and more orange; and the peat is less ash and more leather. So sweet/vanilla/red/ash -> bitter/toffee/orange/leather, in relative terms. It is comparatively unbalanced, with more salty, tangy, and bitter notes. Then again, compared with the Corryvreckan (salt/maple/lemon/ash), the Alligator is actually less salty and a little more of sweet/bitter. In this way, the Alligator might be considered to fall between the Uigeadail (sweeter and rounder) and the Corryvreckan (saltier and sharper). Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. Ardbeg Alligator was released in 2011, and its name comes from the term “Alligator Charring” used in both Bourbon and Scotch to describe the method of charring the inside of the oak casks before they are filled with spirit. The burnt wood staves are said to look like an alligator’s scales. The nose is rather delicate and a bit restrained: brine and very subdued smoke mingle with hints of lemon and vanilla. There is also a sweet element similar to marzipan or milk chocolate. This is a very refined and well balanced nose – I love it! The palate is medium-bodied and creamy. There is now distinct smoke, followed by – again – brine and vanilla. Towards the end it becomes quite peppery, and in addition notes of ginger appear. The finish is of medium length, dry and marked by light smoke and brine. At the end there are hints of dark chocolate and of coffee. I am thrilled by this Ardbeg! The nose is an absolute winner, and compared with the other Ardbeg expressions I have tried the palate is very gentle and elegant. This is a fine and complex whisky that I enjoyed very much. Many thanks for providing the sample, Marc L.! I have had this bottle opened for about a month. A good third is remaining. I only mention this for the interests of oxidization effects, if any. I really enjoyed this the night I opened it, and immediately regretted not buying more. Hopefully some will remain once funds are available. Smell: Still loving this. Tonight it is hitting me with the most pungent and bitter orange peel. Some underlying ginger. I say tonight, because it is different every time. Taste: Fairly mouth and throat coating taste of peppery smoldering vanilla. Burnt marshmallow over a campfire. Salty and sweet...And, my mouth is watering. Must mean I need another sip. This is really well done stuff. Alcohol is at a manageable w/o water level. Has a lovely lingering anise/fennel burn. Completely happy with the price of $110.00. Would not hesitate to bunker a couple of bottles if I could. Nose: tar, sweet stewed root vegetable, small amount of salty brine, bbq sauce Palate: sweet honey, bbq, burnt tar, pepper, lemon. Chilis. Finish: long, with a solid admixture of light pepper, bbq, and sweetness. I may be the outlier on this. Every time I have this, the palate entry seems to be full of sweet honey, followed by pepper and tar/heavy charcoal bbq. Other tasters haven't noted it, but it's happened every time. In that way, to me, it's almost more of a dessert/digestif in itself. It's excellent, and gives a pleasantly oily mouthfeel, though the sweetness still baffles me somewhat. Note: this is a review of the Committe Reserve bottling of the Ardbeg Alligator. While I pour the last dram from my bottle of Alligator, I look up my tasting notes to see how I initially liked this. Only to find out that I have not yet published my tasting notes, while this was arguably the most anticipated release of 2011. Doh! Let us fix that. OK, let me start with a short expo. The name Alligator points to the look of the staves inside the heavily charred cask. I am sure you were already aware. In March 2011, the Committee Release (which I am emptying today) appeared, followed by the still easily obtainable general release in June 2011. It is less peated than the 10 Year Old and has a much sweeter nose. Next to Wellington boots, sea salt and oysters, I get wonderful whiffs of marzipan and rhubarb jam, even some bitter orange marmalade. A big dose of liquorice and ginger. Water cress. Dried grass. And that wonderful A1 barbecue sauce that I always poured on my T-bone steak in the States. Ah, I love it. The mouthfeel is round on apples and grapefruit with quite a bit of spice. Salt and sweet at the same time. Chili peppers, cinnamon and ribs on the BBQ (obviously coated in the delicious A1 sauce), loads of liquorice and a hint of vanilla. Enticing. The fairly long finish continues on almonds and dries your mouth completely. Like said, this was a very hyped release and it is more than good, definitely on par with the Rollercoaster. Bill Lumdsen also dropped hints that 2012 might see a Committee Release in 2012 of something he described as the ‘Son of Alligator’. Hmm, I wonder what he means by that? I am looking forward to it. [General Release]  Nose: lemon zest, charcoal and peat, vinilla icing sugar, toasted ginger bread, burnt sugar, ashes that come out of a used BBQ, burnt malt, slight smoke Palate: tangy, creamy, small amounts of peat, ginger, orange and lemon peels, burnt toast, BBQ charcoals, icing sugar sweetness, very zesty tang Finish: peppery, dried orange peels, light peat and charcoal, creamy vinilla.  Not a peat bomb like normal ardbegs at all. Not 100% sure what the producers ment by BBQ notes, if they ment the taste of meaty charcoal that comes from a used BBQ then I kind of get it (thats what I ment by BBQ) if they mean BBQ as in BBQ sause I didn't get those notes at all. Very typically Ardbeg on the nose. Lots of peat delivering a good quantity of spices and licorice. The delivery takes you by surprise as you expect something gigantic but what you get is, in fact, very robust and approachable. There is a sweetness in there, maybe a touch of chocolate and with that you get the trademark Ardbeg spices on top of gorgeous smoky oak! Long satisfying finish. Another reason to move to the Islays. I was lucky enough to receive a bottle of Alligator for xmas 2012. I love the Highland sherry casked light flavoured bottles almost as much as peaty whiskies.  To my surprise this had the qualities of both, a wonderfully spicey wave of peat greets you reminding you of the heritage of Islay and then the unexpected light citrus fruit and vanilla washes through over the undertones of smoke. A delicious creamy, peat smoke/fruity bottle that combines perfectly in a way I wouldn't have thought possible. An instant favourite which will be hard to beat. After some home-cleaning, I took my lunch with a great huge sandwich with roasted pork with some spicy, peppery BBQ-sauce. Delicious! So as I thought why not take a good glass of dram with some BBQ infleunces in it?! And yes here we got my most, best ever whisky from this time yet! The maqnifecent Alligator of Ardbeg. So as you already read my reviews, I love Ardbeg a lot. So here my review of this delicious dram. Nose: Ufcourse BBQ sauce, spicy, peppery and chillies. But also on the background are elements of chocolate and espresso coffee. Flowers and fruits as well. Taste: BBQ sauce, smokey, lightly spiced of red peppers and a delicious bite in it. Savoury parts of roasted pork and spiced marinade ribs. The aftertaste gives great delicate of dark roasted coffee, caramel and toffee with it. Finish: long, cuban-cigars, sweetness of roasted nuts with brown sugar syrup. With a fantastic peat behind. Fantastic, delicious piece of Art of Ardbeg. I'm really glad that I own a bottle. It is rare and quite hard to find. I know there are some bottles available, so be hurry to get one! And I really recommend to buy this great dram. From the alcohol of 51.2% it is totally not a strong whisky to drink. It is delicate and smooth. I scored 100 out of 100, cause in this legendary dram is nothing wrong to telling about. When I first got this bottle I was extremely excited and promised myself that I would wait to open it for some special occasion. Well got a decent raise at work and decided the stress of two weeks prior would only be relieved by the bite of an Alligator, and this is what I think... nose... On the nose there is peat, smoke, and a strange earthy salt ever so common in the Islay malts. It has a bit of a bite that I'm unsure of. Almost makes me think it may be a bit young. Water did not add much to the nose. There was the faint addition of a sweetness that I can't put my nose on. palate... Strong peaty/earthy flavor and a briny taste that i really like. There is a sizzling bbq taste that comes from the new heavily charred bourbon barrels that they have used to make this whisky unique from their other bottlings. The smoke is nice and pleasent. With water a soft sweet New York Vanilla note seemed to poke it's head out. It was a much valued improvement over the intense peat monster that seemed to lacked in complexity before. finish... The finish has a bit of a burn on my tongue, but it is smooth going down. A medium length finish, very phenolic and a little ashy, not quite as long as I would have liked. Nothing substantial changed in the finish after the addition of water. The burn was slightly lessened.  The addition of water seemed to help open the whisky into a slightly gentler creature. It was an improvement overall on the taste. The nose didn't seem to change much and the most disappointing feature, the finish, was not helped at all. Overall, I liked the nose and loved the taste, but the finish lowered the whole experience for me.  At the price point I think it was a little too expensive for the whisky in the bottle. I may have been expecting far too much from it but I felt cheated for the money I spent. Price was about the same as a Lagavulin 16yo that has never let me down.  Nose: Sea air, charred oak, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, fried pork cracklings, orange coated in dark chocolate, bitter mint, a little vanilla, cinnamon and icing, burnt marshmallows, and very lovely allspice.  Taste: Lots of pepper, charred oak again, sweet orange, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, sea water, and mild peat. Not as ""Ardbeggy"" as I'd like.  Finish: Spicy, burning herbs, a bit of malt (cornflakes?), some peat and char. Quite an interesting Ardbeg this is. I didn't get those BBQ sauce notes that everyone describes but perhaps all those spices that I got are to others BBQ. One thing is for sure, the extra char on the barrels really made a difference. Perhaps the greatest thing about the Alligator is how strongly I get that fried pork crackling note on the nose. I simply adore it. It's just like the pork crackling we have here in Louisiana, seasoned with cayenne, paprika, and a tiny pinch of sugar.  Although this isn't your standard Ardbeg, fans of the 10 year old will notice similarities. I must admit, I like the Alligator a bit more because I feel it is a bit more complex.  strong smell! and goooood taste. I had the chance to taste the islay-gator at an event. I knew it was there and I started with the ardbeg table so I can taste it while my taste buds are still alive ! NOSE: burnt wood with cigar in it, fire camp smoke also. But I found it a bit shy. I expected a more powerful nose MOUTH: cigar, chocolate, coffee, smoke and peat... lots of burnt note. You can see that this whisky is young FINALE: long and burnt with cigar notes. CONCLUSION: A very nice dram, Ardbeg created something new and interesting, although it is still signed by the distillery characteristics fire camp smoke. I think the gator is a tad shy for a so powerful animal, but maybe it has something to do with is young age and the price is maybe a bit high for this baby. But is worth tasting it for sure... I was lucky enough to get my hands on a bottle of the Ardbeg Alligator Committee Reserve release, and having recently had great experiences with Islay malts (Laphroaig mainly) I had high hopes for this animal. My expectations were surpassed quite quickly, after seeing the golden colour and smelling the smoky, charred wood, BBQ filled aroma. It was a heavy hitter and actually caught me by surprise! The charred wood and BBQ characteristics continued into the taste, where a lot more appeared as well. I picked up a spring-like aroma, full of the joys of spring as they say, and would liken it to those sweets, the Rainbow Drops.  There was a fruity finish filled with peat smoke, and it lingered for just long enough!  In closing, it's an absolute beast of a dram, a true animal of Islay, and one I'll enjoy again and again. If you're a cigar person like me, spark a large one up to accompany a dram of this, and you'll experience exquisite pleasure! Colour: Darker than the 10 year old. I wonder if the extra charred wood is the culprit… Nose: Sweeter than the 10 year old, with less lemony notes, vanilla, spice, pepper, BBQ sauce, Peat and Charcoal , some brine, and also toffee and burnt sugar as in the Brule crust. Lovely and quite complex until now. Palate: Heavy but not ultra peaty, but very Smokey as in smoked tobacco leaves, leftovers of a cigar, quite chilly and peppery with a gingery zing on the tongue as well. more than the 10 year old. Liquorice and dark tea, as well as other spices i can’t quite pinpoint. Not a peat monster at all (less peaty than the 10 or the Corry by far) Finish : Long, with a lot of ash, pepper and gingery zing, spice, and some burnt wood. Bottom line : This is a very good dram. well made. It did not blow off my mind , but it’s well made, very enjoyable and offers a little variation on the 10 year old profile. If you love Ardbegs, and a little spiciness does not scare you off, it’s a bottle you should own. It’s not too expensive. I think i will opt for a bottle when the OB comes in a few months time. Nose: on first approach I’m greeted by distinct notes of ripe cherries buoyed by a wisp of milkiness (akin to the breath of a baby after feeding). The nose develops with background hints of resin and menthol. After a while some mango joins in.  With the addition of water the milky notes subside and the ripe cherries are coated in caramelised sugar which soon morphs to sweet cured bacon on a barbecue. Finally some menthol and hint of peat smoke. Palate: Rich and fruity with some powerful, and dry, woody flavours. Developing to a very enjoyable spicy bitterness in the mid palate. Finally some dry charcoal smoke. The maritime influence is restrained throughout with just a hint of saltiness and the peat taking a backseat to the fruit and spice. Following the addition of water, the fruit becomes more pronounced producing some delightfully fizzy sensations on the tongue - like cherry candy. Drying out to that pleasing bitterness accompanied by some liquorice. Finish: long and satisfying. Dry smoke, tar and spice. Comments: a very satisfying Ardbeg, not my absolute favourite but certainly worth investigating. Well here it is, the long awaited Ardbeg Alligator. The name comes from the term “Alligator Charring” used in both bourbon and Scotch to describe the method of charring the inside of the (Virgin) oak casks before they are filled with spirit. The burnt wood staves are said to look like alligator’s scales. Ardbeg Alligator (51,2%, OB 2011, Committee release, around 10.000 btl.) Nose: it shows all the power of Ardbeg 10, with charcoal, medicinal peat and smoke, but also added notes of cocoa, marzipan and sweet barbecue sauce. A little vanilla and burnt sugar. Nice balance of sweet and savoury notes. Definitely less lemon notes, this one is darker and warmer. I like it. With some water, the toffee / vanilla combo stands out, and some fresh lemon shows up.  Mouth: medium weight and medium peat, more gentle than I’ve come to expect from Ardbeg lately. Lots of pepper and ginger. Some cardamom. Charcoal and vanilla. Some liquorice. Evolves around spices, but it remains a little youngish maybe.  Finish: tarry with coffee and chocolate, but shorter than expected. A nice Ardbeg: darker, warmer and sweeter than Ardbeg 10, with a “modern” wood influence. Not quite what I hoped for based on cask #1189 and #1190 but then again these casks had a different treatment. I like the result, but the complexity seems a little under par compared to some classic expressions. The colour is a pleasant mid amber. On the nose peat dominates but initially it is sweeter than your usual heavily peated malt. I get a whiff of marzipan. After a few minutes nosing I get some more savoury notes coming through, some damp wood or compost. For a 51.2% spirit the nose is actually quite gentle, and I get a lovely faint hint of rose right at the end. In the mouth it is pleasingly peaty but not at all overpowering. Definitely a more spicy smoke than a hot burning smoke. But those flavours are wrapped in a warmer, sweeter more gentle mouth taste than I am used to from Ardbeg (or other Islays (though I readily accept I’m no peat-freak)). Any burn on the finish is short lived – actually shorter than I expected – but despite that quickly subsiding the remainder of the finish lingers on for a good time, leading to much chewing, appreciating the fading flavour notes.  With a few drops of water the difference is quite pronounced. I get toffee and vanillas on the nose and if I sniff for a while that hint of rose in the background seems to become citrusy. It’s a beautiful nose once its been opened up with water. Similarly in the mouth it takes on a more bourbon-y character than I thought it had neat. Overall, it actually isn’t what I was expecting. I’d say the peat plays second fiddle here to what else is going on around it. I personally don’t get the BBQ and cumin and so on that the official tasting notes talk about, but I often find trying to match ‘official’ notes to my own experience a fruitless and frustrating task. But there is a lot happening and the peat and smoke just fit nicely into the mix. I like it a lot."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,52.1,Ardbeg ArdbogOB,"I have a couple of Ardbegs kicking around that I haven't reviewed yet; not only am I going to take a look at each one individually, but I'll compare each of them to the standard Ardbeg 10 Year Old. The Ardbog is Ardbeg's 2013 Ardbeg Day annual release. Some of the malt has been matured in ex-Manzanilla sherry casks, and at 52.1% I presume this is cask strength. Thanks to @Victor for helping me obtain this bottle. The colour is a medium mahogany - the darkest Ardbeg I think I've ever seen. On the nose there is a complex interplay of sweet, savoury and smoky: bacon, salami, furniture polish, Christmas cake, tobacco, stewed prunes and baked apples. Dark chocolate. Burnt caramel and motor oil. A little bit herbal. Some water adds milk to the dark chocolate, and tames the nose. There is a lot going on here - sometimes it gels, sometimes it doesn't.  On the oily palate, things somewhat clash: peat, brine, rum-raisin, milk chocolate and old leather. Very fruity with plum, black cherry and dates. Nutty. Spicy with the high ABV; less so with water. I like many of the individual notes - it's rather mouth-watering and at times delicious - but it is constantly shifting and is woefully off-balance. The finish is off-putting: cigar ash, sherry and spice with developing leather. This is such an interesting dram, with all sorts of flavours and aromas going on, but it is so all over the place, it's hard for me to really recommend it. Murkier than the 10 Year Old, it doesn't quite achieve that one's near-perfection. It has gotten some great reviews (Dave Broom scored it a 91 and was named Editor's Choice in Whisky Advocate) but, even as a die-hard Ardbeg lover, I find it too challenging.  If there’s one distillery that can marry peat and sherry beautifully, it’s Ardbeg. I mean, who doesn’t like the Oogie? But here’s the Ardbog, the widely anticipated annual release from 2013. It’s a ten year old whisky that’s been matured in both bourbon and Manzanilla sherry casks. If nothing else, this is one of the most unique and mouth-pickling Ardbegs to be had. Nose: Initially shy, but water and time help. Salt, indistinct sherry, green apples, blood orange, pine. A young tinge to this. Palate: Very salty. These briny notes almost pickle the tongue. Chocolate, sherry, red fruit, earth, damp leaves.  Finish: Indistinct sherry, chocolate, green apple, wine tannin, paprika, pepper, fennel, minerals. Long and drying. Certainly one of the more unique Ardbegs out there. The drying effect is powerful and distinctive. But it does taste a touch young, and the sherry and peat don’t work as harmoniously as they do with the Uigeadail. Although it’s well layered and extremely coastal, for me it’s more interesting than it is brilliant. All things considered, I prefer the core range. Pricey, but definitely a cool one to try. Ardbeg organises an Ardbeg Day on May 31th. The company launches a limited edition expression for the Festival of Malt and Music. True Ardbeggians will go and fetch it on the island itself during Feis Ile. Regular fans could score the 2013 edition rather easily in specialised liquor shops. If they were quick enough of course.  Last year's expression was a celebration to the peat bogs that are the very core of the Ardbeg flavour. Basically this was an Ardbeg 10 with a plus. The whisky was a marriage of spirit matured in bourbon and manzanilla sherry casks. Tasting Notes Colour: This golden hued whisky translates stickyness to a delicious texture with nice slow tears along the glass.  Nose: Ardbeg wouldn't be Ardbeg without a decent dose of peat smoke. Forget about Blasda - everybody makes mistakes right? - for a moment. The first rendez-vous is sharp and stinging in the nose. Rock sugar, raisins and ripe bananas. And it continues with leather, mint, cinnamon biscuits and salted caramel. At the very end of the trip it treats you on a heap of wet clay soil.  Adding water enhances sweet and spicy flavours. Honey, vanilla, cinnamon and clove are the usual kitchen suspects.  Taste: On the palate Ardbog evolves like a whirlwind of salt and sweet. Salted caramel with roasted almonds and raisins. A fair share of toasted oak. Strong coffee with some whipped cream, caramel and grounded star anise. Eat this Starbucks!  Finish: The finish keeps the honey sweetness and combines it with pepper, warm pastis and coffee grounds.  Conclusion This limited Ardbeg was easily found in liquor shops. The initial price tag varied between € 80 and € 90. Not exactly cheap for a NAS (after reading the small print, it became clear it is ten years old) but still great value for your money.  The price was a small affair given the extortionate prices some shops are asking right now. You still find it, but now it will easily set you down € 160 for the very same product. Economic scarcity... and hype... and snobbishness at work.  In short: this Ardbeg is a very tasty dram, but became prohibitively expensive. Uigeadail is probably a better alternative. I'd had this bottle for a few months before opening it up but it was well worth the wait. A delicate nose (for an Ardbeg) with an initial influence of raisins, peat smoke and honey. Much more subtle than the Oogie or esp. Corryveckan. Smokey raisin and Toffee, a hint of leather and Maple syrup coupled with a salty sea spray tang and a wee bit of coconut as well. Deliciously smooth, subtle and sweeter than the Oogie yet lacking the Oogie's overall depth. A long honeyed finish with the peat in the near background. A lovely after dinner malt. Slainte!

A review for Ardbegs 2013 official special edition. Thankfully I was able to find one before they sold out. Nose: Oily, tar and coal smoke notes, a saltiness carried on a sea breeze, maybe a hint of green olive, citrus peel oils (lemon and orange), ginger bread, a hind of nuttiness, becomes sweeter over time with slight hints of golden syrup. Nose with Water: Becomes sharper, more ginger an malt notes, maybe a hint of cumin spice, slightly more citrus peel, buttery cooked vanilla.  Palate: Very oily, some fruit (Mellon, lemon zest, white grape peels), the peat is every gentle and soot like and the smoke is smooth, some hints of nuttiness (hassle and almonds), a nice saltiness, some dissertation spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of clove), a nice drying in the mouth sensation.  Palate with Water: very similar but lighter, becomes more creamy. Finish: mouth begins to salivate after drying, a nice slight saltiness, soft smoke, hints of dessert spices, some brown burnt sugar. I found this quite a soft Ardbeg in a way, while cask strength there wasn't any kind of overpowering notes or sensations. Extremely smooth for a cask strength Islay whisky.  Ardbog...what can I say? Another great, unique product from the distillery of greatness. Give me a call if you ever run into a bad whisky from Ardbeg. This limited edition Ardbeg was released in the Fèis Ìle festival 2013. It's a combo from bourbon and Manzanilla sherry casks. A vatting of 10 year old spirit. In celebration of Ardbog day. And truly a 'Groundhog Day' experienced yet again with Ardbeg. Although their whiskies seem to stand out as unique and rich products. But it's a groundhog day because the experience is good every time I open a Ardbeg bottle. Nose: Hints of herbal notes and honeyed maple syrup with intensive smoke rising from the back. Mildly peaty and salty. Taste: A bit sweet, yet bitter. Complex flavors with nuts and sweet peat and wine. Earthly. Finish: Peppery and dry. Wine clashing with sour citrus fruits. Good length like always with Ardbeg. Balance: Good whisky indeed, not in the top 5 of Ardbegs I've tasted but yet another addition to a good 'track record' of Ardbeg distillery. Rich and steady. Thanks to @Victor for sourcing this bottle for me. This bottle gave us an excuse to meet up, and I am very grateful.  I opened this bottle on Father's Day this year. This tasting was done on 9-9-2013 Nose: Very winey with notes of rubber tires. Also sweet and peaty but at a slightly lower tone then the Galileo. The sweetness is a much higher tone then the Galileo; a soubrette soprano tone – very light and agile sweetness. I am getting soft red fruits (raspberries and strawberries) but with a much stronger undercurrent of wood. Peat is pronounced with a bit more smoke as well. Very nice oaky woodiness balances out the intense sweetness very nicely. There is much more depth then the Galileo with all that wood. This is like a log cabin nose: cozy simple fire, wood furniture with stuffed animals on the wall. With water: still very intense. Not much change. More lemon Taste: Higher sweetness then the Galileo, and now comes honey and peat. Still some distinct woodiness and peat below it. Very nice and salty.  Finish: Very sharp peat, salt, and iodine finally break through the candied sweetness. This is much more intense then the Galileo (or the L13 TEN for that matter). Tons of salt and peat fires! Smoke and anise . . . interesting. Peat wave followed by slow undulating sweetness. This is more of a honey coated peat monster. I would say this tastes like “gold” peat. Long fire in the mouth. This doesn’t destroy your mouth; it just leaves it smoldering like an autumn leaf fire. Balance, Complexity: Not quite as complex on the nose as the Galileo (I hope time will change that a bit). Less balanced then the Galileo (by a nose). There is a sharpness here I like much better. This also has a more luxurious feel in the mouth and in the finish. Again, neither the Galileo nor the Ardbog are a “beast.” However, this has more of a fight – and I like that!  Aesthetic experience: A shade more amber then the Galileo: darker and more orangie. (looks the sexiest). I really like this bottle. I love the name, the label, the fact that it says ncf (and apparently no coloring) and 52.1%!!! love it. I even like the marketing better then the Galileo. Conclusion: A much better special release then Galileo. Still, this isn't any better then most batches of Corry and Uigeadial: different . . . but the standard line is fantastic as is in my opinion. There's always a sense of excitement for all Ardbeg fan around June of every year. Because that's the time when Ardbeg unveils its much anticipated release of that year. This year (2013) it's the Ardbeg Ardbog - so named after the peat bogs that provide that familiar Ardbeg flavor. Let me tell you something. There is simply no other nose quite like this one. It is absolutely sublime. Not just because it's delicious but because it is constantly changing the longer you leave it in the glass. There is first the familiar tar with the tiniest hint of burnt rubber sprinkled with a delicate puff of soot. The sweetness comes through next on the back of light chocolate-y citrus and a layering of delicate caramel. Don't go yet because there is fresh grapes mulched with tiny sprigs of coriander next. Leave it longer and it becomes even more sweet. More daring if you like. The chocolate becomes more pronounced. The honey becomes darker and takes on a maple syrup quality. I have yet to come across a nose that is as complex as this one. The palate is sweet fortified wine mixed with a lemony limestone consistency. It is smoky, peaty with finely chopped herbs and the tiniest hint of dank cardboard. Not in a bad way, mind you. Mull it longer and lovely chocolate cake dusted with cinnamon powder comes out next.  The strong oily finish is full of cloves and star anise rounded off with coffee beans and wood shavings. This is a lovely dram and needs your undivided attention.  I have been highly entertained by the reactions to Ardbeg Galileo since its release 1 September 2012, and have enjoyed waiting to review the new Ardbeg Ardbog for a nearly-full 3 months since its release June 1, 2013. Galileo had the audacity to be really winey, by Ardbeg standards. Some loved it, others were horrified by it. Some could not forgive it; at least one panel named it Finest Malt Whisky of the Year. Ardbog is, thankfully, a little less divisive,...by virtue of its being a little bit less winey.  Nose: strong intensity; usual Ardbeg peaty/smokey briney flavours; hint of wine. Very nice. Taste: intense, pointed Ardbeg bite to set the stage...this alone makes Ardbog more acceptable to most than was Galileo. The usual Ardbeg flavours resume after the inital 'bite"", in a very fulsome and flavourful way. Sweet, but, as is usually the case with Islay whiskies, not too sweet. The wine begins in a small way, at first, until the... Finish: ...wine takes over. Nice wine, but the other flavours stay strong, so that no one is too frightened that the Ardbeg profile has been lost. What would happen to us all if malt lovers lost faith in Ardbeg? Ragnarok. You Norse members know what that is.  Balance: Very nice whisky. Others like it. So do I. Not particularly unusual, but solid. Quite solid.  Firstly I have to start this review with two thank you's. The first is to Ardbeg for making these annual releases. Whilst very hard to get hold of, they are exciting and worth trying if you get a chance. The second thank you is to 26goingon62 for allowing me to try his bottle of Ardbog. Having been unable to get my own he kindly let me sample his with a drop swap. Cheers mate! The nose is big, Salty, peaty vegetation, plums, fudge, smokey bacon crisps and bonfires. This is BIG. It tastes salty, almost like brine lots of Peat smoke, big punch, spicy aftertaste that coats the mouth. Finish is warm and peppery.  I love it, this is right up my street. It doesn't have the layered complexity of Uigeadial but as a one off it scores well. Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. Ardbeg Ardbog was released in 2013 as a limited edition 10-year old. It was matured in ex-Bourbon American oak casks and ex- Manzanilla sherry butts. The nose is smoky and fruity. Smoked ham and brine are followed by bananas, lemons and caramel. After a while there are hints of milk and notes of grass. The smoke goes very well together with the salty notes – well done! The palate is full-bodied and both peppery and oily. There is distinct smoke that is matched by apples and lemons. After the initial peppery outburst a tannic dryness creeps in. Adding water makes the palate more acidic, with balsamic vinegar getting the upper hand. The finish is long, peppery and pleasantly warming. Also, the same tannic dryness that was apparent on the palate is present here, too. Wow, this is very dry! Finally, smoky and earthy notes have the last say. I tried Ardbog on Ardbeg Day and at first was not too impressed, but letting it breathe a bit has certainly helped. While I absolutely loved the nose and the palate, the finish was a tad too dry for my liking. Also, adding water does not do this much good. Overall, from my perspective this is not as sweet as Galileo and not as well balanced as Alligator, but just in between the two, so in other words it worked well enough for me. Let me start off by saying that I am not the biggest Ardbeg fan. There are 2 of their bottlings that I am quite fond of: Beist and Alligator. The others I have had are not bad, just not repeat purchases for me. Not wanting to make the same costly mis-step I did with the Galileo, I only bought 1 bottle on release to try first. That is what I am finishing up tonight.  Initial aromas are salt and rancid meat. I must be a jackal then, because it is making me salivate. A bit, can I say, ""Laphroaigy"" too. Peat and smoke come later, along with some deeply buried butterscotch. Very mercurial nose. I could spend some time with this one. More sweets like nougats and vanillas come out with some time in the glass. I hold the first sip, let it coat my mouth before swallowing. Not as drying or numbing as I would have expected. While there is some sweetness, it finishes dry and salty. A bitterness clings to the roof of my mouth. The numbness, while slow to arrive, begins to take hold. As my mouth numbs, the sweet notes begin to outshine the salinity. There is something nutty about this whisky too. Not nutty like crazy, nutty like almonds. Finishes dry, and could be longer... That was a pretty good bottle for drinking, but a great one for nosing. Pricey? Yeah, but what the hell isn't these days? So, I picked up a few more to lay down. This is an Ardbeg I would like to revisit in the future. I'd say buy one and try it. Well, it’s that Ardbeg time of year again. Whether you consider their annual releases cause for celebration or mere hype, they can’t be ignored. Nevertheless, I’ll give them credit for being the only distillery to make an honest attempt at creating something special on a regular basis. Consider this a snapshot review. Comments are based on my third dram of Ardbog from a bottle I’ve had for two days, so any potential changes via oxidation haven’t had time to take effect. I like this expression, but it’s not on the level of Uigeadail or Corryvreckan – yet. Another few drams, another few months – who knows? If I notice any significant changes over time, I’ll add some thoughts in the comments section. I strongly recommend this with at least a half teaspoon of water. Those who like the strong stuff neat will miss out on the sweet and creamy textures that emerge with a bit of added aqua. Nose: Very dense, earthy, and smoky. There’s plenty of peat, to be sure, but not as much as expected from an Ardbeg christened in honor of the peat bogs. I expected a peat wallop along the lines of a cask-strength Laphroaig, but the salt, dirt, wood, rubber, and roasted ham demand equal time. To balance out the rough stuff, there’s a hint of vanilla that emerges after a five-minute wait. I can’t say that I’m in love with this nose, but it’s certainly complex, unique, and interesting. Palate: Very salty and meaty upon arrival. The Manzanilla-cask influence soon emerges, as do some caramel and soft citrus notes. On the downside, there’s more than a trace of something like bitter plastic that won’t go away. These flavors remain in the decent-length finish, as the peat returns in full force. In all, I like Ardbog, but I’m not crazy about it (yet, anyway). It’s not in the Oogie or Corry class, but it’s probably worth the price tag if you’re a fellow passenger on the Ardbeg bandwagon. Ardbeg Day, launched in 2012 for the first time, is a new holiday for peatfreaks. Or is it? Because while Ardbeg Day is a great whisky, the Galileo (a mix of bourbon and marsala casks) was received with mixed emotions by the die-hard Arbeggians. The first reactions to this new Ardbog (a mix of 10 year old American white oak and manzanilla sherry casks) are a mixed bag as well. I guess there is nothing left but to try it ourselves, eh? The nose is immediately oily and salty, like cured ham and olives. Peat, surely, but a lot less than I would have expected. Sweet ashes. Wet earth. Rocky coast. Far from fruity or sweet like the Galileo (which I put next to it for the occassion). The salt might be from the manzanilla of course, as this dry sherry from Andalusia (Spain) is known to be a bit salty. If you leave it for five minutes, it does show a sweet side. It is surprisingly soft on the palate. Immediately very salty, like on the nose. Quite overpowering, blocking everything else out for a few moments. Only midpalate does the meaty and sweet character surface. Nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon. Nuts, too. Almonds to be precise. Caramelized apples and some toffee now. Nice development. Mildly drying towards the end. It is only at said end that the peat shines through with a grand smokiness. I find it rather complex. The finish is long, smoky and dry. Like the Galileo, it may be too far away from hardcore Ardbeg to many peatfreaks. Too much manzanilla influence, they may think. But for me, it works. I find it better than the Galileo, it easily outshines the Rollercoaster and Alligator, but it is still no match for the Day, Airigh Nam Beist, Supernova, let alone the Uigeadail or Corryvreckan.  Nose: Sweet toffee layered upon peat , ash and salted toffee. A bit herbal too. Ash. Sweet peat and earthy notes in addition to smoked ham and salted cashew nuts. Sweet savoury yet medicinal and earthy. Brilliant. Palate : quite oily and big. Stars with salted nuts and almonds , toffee. Big peat notes with a hot cinnamon edge. A hint of apples and tons if ash, with a touch of sea brine. Finish : long semi sweet semi bitter finish. Dark chocolate. Ash. Coffee. "
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,60.5,Ar2 Elements of IslaySMS,"I previously reviewed the Lp1 bottling of Laphroaig - this is the 2nd Elements of Islay bottling I've picked up. Ardbeg is one of the more isolated distilleries, and was actually shut down in the 1980s and only resurrected in 1997 when Glenmorangie acquired it. Elements of Islay is a range of bottlings of Islay malts, each bottle highlighting a distillery and vatting casks of various ages. They are ""signed off"" by a whisky expert (I still don't quite understand what that means) - in this case, spiritofislay.net founder Gordon Homer. In the glass this has thick legs and a dark straw colour. The peat smoke on the nose is not overwhelming, underlined by ground almonds and buttered rye toast. Clean and crisp. A little water pushes the smoke forward. In the mouth: Wow - a fiery burst of peat, maybe a little too much. Hot alcohol with black pepper dancing on the surface. After the first burst, it mellows into a creamy mouthfeel with a very slight light brown sugar sweetness. Water tames down the alcohol burn, but also the other elements unfortunately. Perhaps I added too much, and only a few drops would do the trick. Long chimney-like finish, it feels wonderful, deep in the chest. Very warming. I would say it's just slightly off-balance but not in a bad way - the smoky peat seems to fight a little with the other elements in the whisky. But it's a very interesting and stimulating dram. Doesn't quite reach the heights of the Lp1 bottling but this is very good. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to pick up more Elements! nose: intense smoke,sugared almonds,caramac palate: Big smoke and sweetness,not complex but very enjoyable in its simplicity finish: Goes on and on and on comment:recomend this and the rest of the elements range cl1,lp1,lg1,ar1 to any islay fan you wont find a more intense range of islays anywhere,great fun to drink.Watch out for the port ellen 2 coming out soon i believe but be very quick will be gone in seconds"
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,46,Ardbeg 10 Year OldOB,"My first Connosr review was an Ardbeg 10 over a year ago now - how time flies!  I've made it no secret I'm a big Ardbeg fan and make it a norm to have at least one bottle of the ten a year.  So how is this one holding up then? Review is from a double pour, neat but sat for ten minutes or so.  Bottle has been open a few weeks with about a third gone. Nose - Classic Ardbeg  . . . which is, for me, TCP, some brine, smoke, chocolate lime sweets and quite a creamy vanilla malt note with this bottle.  More rounded and less of a peaty punch than other bottles (but I am being overly pedantic; through over familiarity, perhaps?).  Still good though, and clean. Taste - Lime sour at first then it develops into creamy vanilla with some distinct barley notes (which is unusual).  A little thin on the mouthfeel it has to be said as well.  Oh and liquorice(y) peat, of course. Finish - Medium-long.  There's a lingering of the lime sourness, peat tang and the familiar bellowing upsurge of smoke is, well, kind of there, but it's also a little less prominent than other bottles I've had.  More of a waft than a bellow.  Some pleasantly bitter tannins. This is still clearly a bottle of Ardbeg 10 but it's definitely a little different than other bottles I've had.  It's as if the neat pour gives what other bottles did after I'd added water; which, by the way, does not help this at all - it loses any peat 'hit' and becomes too watery.    This is better, for me, after a non peaty whisky as it emphasises the kind of notes that I'm after here.  It's still very good but perhaps not quite stellar or going supernova. A classic by all accounts, the Ardbeg 10 is a dram no whisky nut can dare miss.  At £40 in the UK, consistent quality and deep complexity come at a price that won’t break the bank. This particular bottle had been open around a week. And i would like to pay particular attention to the beautiful light gold colouration of the whisky itself once poured into the glass. No caramel colourings here !  Nose- 
First comes a gentle waft of smoke with sweet notes of caramelising sap. Caramel and smoked ham develop as the whisky opens up (just a few minutes in the glass) followed swiftly with the remnants of what can only be the faint remembrance of fresh sea air. Is it mint I detect in the background? I can’t quite tell. But a wonderful nose with deeper vegetal notes that are hard to grasp. Palate-
Smokey sweet. Smoked ham and raisins? Who knew they could make such a grand dance on the tongue. Mint follows just as it did on the nose, accompanied by just a touch of sea salt and a sprinkling of crushed almonds. Finish-
Medium finish with both the sweet and the smoke of the palate fading away together. The smoke dissipates faster at first. But suddenly the sweetness is gone and I’m left with warm smoke which seems to cling to my tongue and the inside of my mouth.  Conclusion -
A wonderfully complex whisky which punches way above both its respective age and price brackets. Peated whiskys are not usually something i would recommend to everyone... but I honestly believe this dram has a little something for everyone. This is an abbreviated of a blog entry I will post tonight or tomorrow According to their promotional materials, Ardbeg is as close to perfection as makes no difference. That's a bold claim. It's also similar to claims made by pretty much every scotch whisky distillery. I've often compared Ardbeg to Clubber Lang and Lagavulin to Rocky Balboa. This is obviously my completely subjective opinion, but if any scotch is going to knock Lagavulin out and claim the coveted ""Joe's favourite scotch"" title, it would likely be Ardbeg. But I also find Ardbeg to remind me of the movie ""The Big Lebowski"". Like the Coen Brothers' cult classic, there's a lot more going on than it would appear at first glance (or first sip, as it were). Tasting Notes Adding water to Ardbeg Ten thrusts the iodine/seaweed and brine notes forward on the nose. It's like walking on a beach and smelling the remnants of a campfire. Delightful. The sweet malt notes and the pear flavours are also more apparent with some water added. Drinking Ardbeg is a gratifying experience with or without water.  There's a lot more going on than smoke and peat. Pouring a dram and taking that first sniff, you'd be forgiven for thinking peat and smoke was the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But Ardbeg is not as it seems. It's bold and complex, yet not without subtlety. Much like the eponymous character in ""The Big Lebowski"" was not the self-made man he claimed to be, Ardbeg is not what it appears to be. It's much more. Just to be clear from the offset - I can't pretend to not have a deep, almost scared, affinity with this whisky so I will try extra hard to be objective and provide clarity of my experience. This was the first ever alcoholic drink that made me grin ear to ear after a sip (well my 2nd sip to be precise - the first being one of confusion, intrigue and a general sense of 'wtf' have I just bought here?!)  It even led to what I believe can be called 'peat flashbacks' the next day out playing golf in the midst of winter.  A very welcome intrusion it must be said. Onto the liquor:   On the nose it's an instant hit of coastal peat.  Minerality comes through with sea shells, oysters, TCP, drift wood beach bonfires and slight oily smoked fish notes.  There's also a citrus fruitiness and an ever so light touch of damp, musty dried fruit that I'm noticing more this time around.  Chocolate lime sweets.  Wonderful. Taste wise; those chocolate limes really come out for me here.  Oily but not overly thick mouth feel that develops into a beautifully sweet fennel, licorice note.  Sweet arrival but becomes more sour.  Reminds me of tequila.  I find I have this neat or if the mood takes me with a few drops of water.  Less peaty with water and more citrus sweetness comes out.   Perhaps more rounded as well? Finish is long and I find as the bottle goes down more smoke comes out here, to the point where I can pretend I'm a dragon breathing fire after a sip.  Slight tannins but very pleasantly so.  A sour note is there. This whisky takes me back to holidays on the west coast of Scotland as a kid -but you could be anywhere on the west coast of Britain and get the same sensations, imo.   It's so well made and I would like to say an available and affordable (mostly) craft whisky but the prices here have gone up a lot in the last couple of years alone.  Still, not bad value at all and a must have for any whisky fan to have at least tried. Ardbeg Ten... well, that hardly needs any kind of introduction, of course. It is a standard whisky, but of such good reputation that it belongs in each and every whisky cabinet. I have tried several batches and they are all - in my opinion - very close. So hat's off to the master blender, in casu Dr Bill Lumsden. Today I will try a Ten that was bottled on 17th November 2015.
Classic Ardbeg nose with some lime, apples and vanilla that are soon joined by the typical maritime elements such as brine, peat smoke and something that reminds me of gasoline. Some burnt wood and even some smoked ham in the background make this nose a joy for the lovers of this type of Ileach.
The peat rears its head from the very first sip. And while this Ardbeg remains sweet and creamy it's that salty edge and those notes of peat that give this it's complexity. Lots of mineral elements as well. It's like having gravel in your mouth, so to speak. I quite like this.
That mineral side is extra powerful in the long and warm finish.
Yes, Ardbeg Ten remains a top dram. Bull's eye every time. Thanks for the sample, Pat! Nice grassy nose. On the palate it is very Smokey, followed by a grassy, hay flavor. Finish is dry and grassy. Light to medium body, with a nice kick. This is a good go-to peated dram.  The last digit of the reviewed bottle's bottle code is unclear, but it is assumed to be 2015, because the bottle was purchased in May 2016. The bottle has been open for 10 weeks and is 85% full Colour: very pale, like pinot grigio Nose; petrol, bitter peat, light smoke, lemon, but not too much, light brine. I like this a lot better than when the bottle was first opened. Water added softened the nose, but did not add anything but dilution. I had bought my neighbour this bottle and a bottle of Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength Batch # 007 for a dinner party with 8 of his friends from Beijing. The Laphroaig was very popular at dinner; this was not. After dinner my neighbour gave me this bottle to take home. Score: 22.5/25 Taste: sharp-edged acrid bitter and sour peat with just a little sweet peat added; more lemon citrus than the nose, still tolerable, but near the limit of being too much. Faint hint of vanilla. Water added softened the palate and left citrus as the noticeable accompaniment to bitter and sour peat. There is no improvement with water. Score: 20.5/25 Finish: long, bitter and sour, with no balance. The finish is not a highlight. Water added increases the perception of the sour component, and offers no improvement. Score: 19/25 Balance: very good on the nose; fair to good thereafter. Score: 18.5/25 Total Sequential Score: 80.5 points Strength: quite strong in all phases of the tasting. Score: 23/25 points Quality: good to very good flavours throughout. Score: 21/25 Variety: good variety of flavours. Score: 21/25 Harmony: too much sour and too little sweetness in the mouth. Score: 18/25 Total Non-Sequential Score: 83 points Comment: despite a very good nose, this batch of Ardbeg Ten goes too sour in the mouth with inadequate sweet balance and is one of the lesser batches I have tasted. If this one was blended using the nose alone, I can understand why. It does have a great nose  To be honest, I never really enjoyed big peat in my dram. I am more of a fan of Speyside type flavors. BUT...this Ardbeg 10YO really makes me reconsider my stance on Islay Whisky. NOSE: burned wood, smoked bacon, tar with lovely undertones of malty sweetness and fruitiness. A bit of water brings out the fruitiness from underneath the blanket of peat and smoke along with herbal aromas of mint.Vanilla, hints of citrus.  TASTE: complex, moderately sweet. Oily, creamy mouthfeel with gentle peat accompanying the whole experience in a very harmonious way. Mineral. The mineral nature of this dram reminds me of San Pellegrino mineral water. At the very end of its development, the taste reminds me a lot tarragon. Really, really delicious.  FINISH: warming, mineral again, ash and peat which just won't leave you alone.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: Wow. I've immensely enjoyed the complexity and the contrast between the creaminess and fruitiness and the big and bold bonfire-ishness of Ardbeg 10YO along with those delicate herbal notes.. I'm definitely trying Ardbeg Uigeadail! I re-read a review I posted in 2013 wherein I gave this fine whisky a low score. I was new to Islays. As is nearly always the case, persistence paid off and now I am an almost exclusive Islay drinker and there is just no going back. Ardbeg 10 year is a wonderful flavor explosion. Nose: Telltale Ardbeg smoked peat; old motor oil; vanilla bean; fresh thistle sap; road tar; fried green tomatoes; BBQ potato chips. Taste: A smoky affair: good quality Ardbeg smoked peat; burning Oregon oak in a wood stove with the dried moss igniting and sizzling through the open stove door. Starts off kinda Caol Ila with hints of a beach bonfire, and then quickly veers off into a distinctly Ardbegian sense landscape that is darker and more transhumanistically industrial.  Finish: More of the same with the smoke lingering longest in a way that is a faint echo of Corry. Smoke, smoke, smoke. This has changed over the past few weeks. It used to finish with a touch more of that signature peatiness.  Well, I'd have to say that this is the best 10 Year I've had from Ardbeg in some time. I was not a fan of the 2014 bottlings. They were a bit ""hinky"" as they say in Chicagoland.  This one has less of the sea in it than Uigeadail but it is damned good. In a way, it faintly reminds me of Solstice 2nd Ed. on the tail end of the finish.  I would not add any water to this, but it does improve with time in the glass, as one would expect. This 2015 bottling of the 10 is far more peaty than last year's, and ""That's just the way I likes it!"" Bring on the peat, is what I say. Odds bodkins. You done good, Ardbeg. For a ten, you done gone and did it real proper-like. I'm going back for one or two more o' these. Word to the wise: aerate or wait. If you find this bottling code, don't expect it to be this good right outa the gates. My bottle took a couple of months to approach where it is now in terms of my rating. When I first opened it, I was not all that impressed. And, yes, I do rate my whisky with price in mind. So if this bottle had cost the same as Uigeadail, then I would have rated it lower, but considering it cost me just under fifty bucks, its score went up a notch or two. This green bottle of Ardbeg Ten certainly towers like a giant over last year's releases. Of course, nothing compares to the early 2000's 10er's with their significantly older broth helping to light up the corners. So let's not try to compare anything these days to those good ole days that are long gone now. Bottling Code: 25/03/2015 Bottle just opened, so it hasn't aired out or oxygenated much.  Here are my initial impressions: It is very ashy indeed. On the nose, quite young with hints of mescal. Reminds me of PC5, but not in as sophisticated a way. A bit one dimensional.  The palate is also very young. I am reminded of tequila a bit. With quite a bit of ash and a little of the Ardbeg peat I crave. My guess is that this peat ratio will improve with oxygenation, but I can't be certain yet.  The finish goes up to a sweeter note, but not to any remarkable extent. I think that Serge and Ralfy were a bit overly optimistic about this year's Ardbeg 10.  It has NO older spirit in it. None in the least. If I were blindfolded, I would identify it as YOUNGER than 10 years. Am I disappointed in my purchase? Yes, even given the price.  I long for older Ardbegs. That is simply the way it is. I offer no apologetics. Take it as you will. One man's opinion.  NOSE: hint of vanilla, peat, burnt wood, slight citrus zest, the aroma of the ground after a heavy rain  TASTE: initially sweet, oily, creamy, with hints of citrus (tangerine), gentle peat, bonfire smoke; cardboard then also some sea salt. Very well rounded and balanced.  FINISH: mineral notes, very remote iodine.  Overall impression: a very interesting Islay experience. The taste in particular is very complex and really enjoyable. However, I wouldn't say that it's in the top 10 for me. Nose - lots of peat and tar also petrol. After a few minutes smoked meat and pear notes. Palate is rich, smoky and meaty, very pleasant. Extremely long finish. Considering its young age, this whisky offers incredible balance. Great value for reasonable price. Great value for reasonable price. I bought this bottle to explore the other Islay offerings and I was very impressed. The peat is quite heavy which, in the case of Laphroaig was a turn off, but here it is complimented with a range of other notes. nose: wispy/controlled smoke especially on the edges, big peat, almonds, briny sea air, airy sweetness, a really nice additional note grassy? mouth: brine shifting to plain salt in the middle of the tongue, smoke, slight herbalness of a high quality lozenge, peat, the light sweetness from the nose. body: light burn dies off in the finish, light mouth coat finish: long, oak, drying in the back, salty, very very good long lingering salt Hold this one in your mouth and appreciate the development. Guaranteed 10 years old seems an odd term to use for a minimum age statement, but this distillery did stand idle for a few years in the 1990’s before Glenmorangie came to the rescue which probably explains it. I first encountered this malt shortly after it’s revival in an Oddbins in Nottinghill, London. I should also have invested in the 17 year old, but alas I was a poor student back then and had other priorities so I never had the pleasure of that famous dram. The mysterious pale, almost colourless liquor, was a shock to my younger self (it didn’t look like whisky as I knew it) but I soon got over it.  There may be a tad more colour to the dram these days, but not much. The aroma is clean and smoky, with a phenolic peat smoke edge, along with some sweeter notes of vanilla and some herby heather like hints. The flavours are awesome and given time to develop reward the drinker with seemingly endless subtle complexities. Not an easy ride though as there almost as many bitter piquant notes as there are sweet mellow ones, smoke, phenolic peat, bitter coffee on one side and sandlewood, chocolate, vanillas and malt on the other and a saltyness marries the twain. The sweeter flavours dominate the long satisfying finish with more malt contribution rising in favour of the peat smoke.  This is my favourite entry Level bottle. The heavy peat and fresh citrus hits all the right spots. Nose: Very thick, clean and aromatic. Deep campfire smoke, wood, brine, peat, tar and petroleum. On the sweeter side some licourice, lemon, sweet bacon. Just delightful. Palate: Oily mouth-feel. Starts a bit funky, with lemon juice. Sweet ash, burnt toast, salty and smoky. Not as balanced as the nose. Finish: Long, meat, malt, warming earthy peat and chocolate. Soapy licorice, salt. The funky lemon-peat game was weird at first, but definitely a grower. As the 50ml finished, I was desperately in love. The cleanliness and lots of other notes remind me of Caol Ila, but with considerably more peat. It is kind of paradoxical: not complex but rich - simple but satisfying. Found notes on the Old Ardbeg 10, last drams, tucked in a drawer. Nose: Licorice, and oily, tarry Sherry sweets. Freshly varnished fence posts. Stewed apples and lemon peel. Sea salt. So much goin on, people are afraid of it because they don't know what to think.  Body: fizzy cola, cough medicine, winter spices, then salt and red wine, but fruity like merlot. Raisins. Peanuts. Hint of toast. Finish: licorice again, rounding it all off. Awesome dram - so much, so balanced for a 10 year old. After having enjoyed a glass of this with a friend several months ago, I had an opportunity to purchase a 1 liter bottle in duty-free on my last flight. I must say I have been initially disappointed; as this lot seems to be exceedingly strong in nose and taste with a ""burning rubber"" chemically sensation. At first I contemplated throwing it out or relegating it to the back of the cupboard; but I have recently re-sampled adding water (and I little more than I might normally use) and I now find it beginning to grow on me. Still BIG smoke and huge attitude, but definitely complex... I won't go on about palate and finish at this time - I'm still sorting it out!! I'm in the midst of building my own blog right now. In doing so, I'm using a lot of old reviews. Going back, I've realized how much my tastes and opinions have changed over the past two years of reviewing. Some of my old reviews are, umm, embarrassing. But since we can't change the old ones here, I think a few re-reviews will be coming down the pipes. Here's a much needed update on the Ten. This is my fourth bottle of the Ten. I didn't like my first bottle much, but times have changed. I love it now, and it’s one of a handful of whiskies that you’ll always find in my cabinet. One of the best value-for-money offerings from Islay these days. Nose: Lemon cough drops, pears, brine, sea air, and big, smoky peat. The peat is crisp, clean, and has an industrial tinge to it. Oak isn’t obvious, but it’s in there. Palate: Light bodied, with a paced arrival. A strong mineral flavour accompanies the industrial peat. Lemon cough drops, tarmac, and menthol.  Finish: It gets sweeter as honey makes an appearance. We move on to camphor, seawater, menthol, minerals, earth, and peat. Faint hints of chocolate, menthol, pine, and metal linger. Medium-long. It’s time to revise that first impression, this is damn good. Crisp, clean, industrial-style peat is what Ardbeg does best. If you want casual peat fix, I’d take this over most entry-level Islay offerings. Also, this is a good year-round whisky. Big, bold flavours will warm your bones in winter, and a light body with clean flavours will suit you just fine in summer. Big, balanced, and satisfying. Easily a cabinet mainstay. My first taste of an Ardbeg, one of the peatiest Islay malts. ­Nose – Peat smoke, tar and creosote, fresh pears and pear drops, then a hint of menthol and lots of creamy, buttery vanilla icing and some sharp, sweet lemon citrus. With water a hint of sea salt and fresh, damp pine forest. ­ Palate – Initial attack of peat, bonfire smoke and lots of sweet coal tar along with a vegetal earthiness. Then light but intense fruity flavours of fresh pear, apple juice, sharp citrus lemon, creamy milk in the background, with hints of pepper and allspice, with the a big hit of leafy, herbal peat returning at the back of the mouth with some salt. Oily mouth-feel. ­ Finish – Mellow, vegetal peat smoke and sweet tar, and a touch of saltiness. Tobacco, warming spices, black coffee, along with dry fennel and liquorice at the end, forming a long, slightly bitter finish. Different from other peaty malts I've tried, a complex combination of light fruity flavours and heavy peaty, tarry smoke. Lovely complex flavours throughout nose, palate and finish and certainly recommendable.  So on my last trip up to visit (and taste) with @Victor I took the opportunity to pick up (and open) a new batch of Ardbeg (batch L13 241). I opened it at his place and we both tasted it. I thought, “this is a pretty good Ardbeg TEN.” The reaction of @Victor was that it was an inferior batch. He then let me try his open bottle . . . this batch . . . and BAM my Ardbeg experience was brought back into perspective. This L10 152 is a great batch, and I am very grateful that @Victor gave me a sample to do this review. Here is my impression after one taste at his place and a 2oz sample bottle. I can only imagine what this must have been like when it was freshly opened . . . Nose: Very big on the nose! Tons of peat, far more ash, tar, fresh asphalt, and motor oil then the L9. This also has tons of fresh cut grass; it almost stings the nose. This can’t be 46% . . . it has so much power! (and I know it has been open for a while!) There is a bit of lemon there adding some brightness, but it is only noticeable when you really hunt for it. Lemon is not a note I immediately go to with this nose. This has a surprising amount of “midrange” tone to the nose. It hits you right were a good Brora would; what I call the “mustard tone” region. This has a wonderful one, two punch. First it hits you with a low deep peat tone, and then K-POW in the face with tons of midrange and high tones. I like it. It definitely is in competition with the L11 194 for best nose of the night. Now it is getting into some lime and lemon tones (like lime cream). This is easily the biggest nose of the night, and perhaps the biggest Ardbeg TEN nose I have encountered.  Taste: This is sweet, but not as sweet as several of the other batches. Very thick ex-bourbon influence of vanilla, wood, but still plenty of peat. There is a hint of that charcoal wood.  Finish: Big peat attack with an abundance of that liquorish note. The liquorish is sweeter then the L13 241, but without being as big and dominant. That said the liquorish is bigger than the L11 194. Now, lots of hay, barley, and grassy notes appear to go with the peat and iodine. Very much in that “cut grass” category compared to other Ardbeg batches. I like it. Complexity, Balance: Second most complex and second most balanced batch of the night. It is the biggest (which I like). It really is that mid-range cut grass that really causes this one to stand out. It isn’t quite as complex on the finish as the L13 241, but I love the power. Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY e-150a in these bottles.  Conclusion: I would LOVE to own a few bottles of this. I swear, @Victor has some fantastic batches of Ardbeg at hand. When you regularly encounter amazing batches of Ardbeg it is easy to see why people go gaga for this distillery. And then there are bad batches. If your first bottle is one of these you will probably be very disappointed in Ardbeg and question all the hype. My answer – check your special secret batch code!! Here good people is a fantastic example of Ardbeg TEN from the newly produced spirit. I doubt there are any old casks in this vatting . . . and it is still amazing. It goes to show the importance of cask selection. So this is the most recent batch of Ardbeg TEN that I have picked up. When I opened it with @Victor in March my very first impression was, “this is a good batch.” Then I tried @Victor’s batch from L10 which blew this one away in power and depth. Since that experience I have slowly drained this bottle . . . and I examined it against a number of other whiskies at different times (3 different Corry’s, Uigeadails, Laphroaig’s, and other peaty beasts). Finally, I put it up against 4 other batches of Ardbeg TEN. I have scored it on 4 occasions: 91, 92, 90, and 91. So I have to come down on the side of saying that this is a very good batch. It doesn't blow your socks off . . . but it is good. Nose: Creamiest batch of the night. It has some low tones, and it has some high tones. The peat is down low, coal in the middle with the lemon up high. It is like a peat coal cake (with some dark cacao) with a lemon frosting. The peat is the base, then the coal, and finally the lemon rests on top. There is also some wood right in the middle with the coal. It doesn’t have quite the low or the high tones of the L11, but it does have some interesting mild oil, dirt, mineral, and peat notes. This isn’t as dark or deep as the L11 or the L10, but this does have some interesting pine needles, and “green” smells happening. Probably the smoothest nose of the batches tonight. This is far from a complex Ardbeg nose, but this is spot on for a standard Ardbeg 10yo in my book. Taste: Very sweet compared to the L9. But in actually this is medium sweet. Loads of peat, citrus, and wood. Maybe some pine cones? Light peat, some salt, wood, barley . . . and something that reminds me of a light Speysider (a Glen-something). A little bit of smoke but not mind blowing. Finish: Big peat blast (very liquorishy), now a low rumble that is chest warming. This is all about peat, and wood fire. Tons of that wood, peat coal, and liquorish. Far bigger, darker with more minerality than the L9 or the L11. This has that diesel oil and coal thing going on. This might have the biggest finish of the night if not for that L10. Definitely the woodiest finish of the night . . . but in a good way. Complexity, Balance: Lots going on here. Not as big as the L10 or as complex as the L11, but still very interesting and enjoyable for a 10 year old.  Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY color in these bottles. Average color for a TEN.  Conclusion: This isn’t as big and powerful as the L10 152. Nor is it as dark and complex as the L11 194. However, it has something to it that is really hard to place. Much like the standard Laphroaig 10yo this batch can drink bigger then it actually is. I enjoy it quite a bit. And so, while the score in only a point or two below other batches I enjoy far more . . . this is still one I am tempted to buy more of even thought I am not sure why. I reach for it over other whiskies that I score much higher. For that reason I consistently score it in the low 90’s. But in all honesty I would expect most people to score this batch in the high 80’s.  This is a bottle I opened while I was living in Seattle. That means I bought it and opened it sometime in 2009 (I really can’t remember any more than that). I have a picture of it being ¼ full and open in December of 2009 along with several other Ardbeg bottles (Uigeadail, Supernova, Almost There, and the Beist). I re-bottled it before I left in 2010 (so the bottle is long gone along with its precious code). Then I re-bottled it into an even smaller bottle on the 1st of December 2012. On a recent night I tasted against 4 other Ardbeg TEN batches (L10 152, L11 194, L13 003, and L13 241). Nose: Peat, peat, and a hint of lemon. Some ash, some coal, a bit of diesel oil, and then more peat hinted with lemon. Smoke almost to the point of bitterness like a fire pit the morning after a fire . . . almost. There is more chlorine, and a higher tone than the L11 194. This is probably the ashiest nose of the night. Not that deep or complex. It could easily have been all the time it had to oxidize.  Taste: Less sweet then the L13 241. Then it starts moving in the non-sweet direction in a hurry. Not bitter, but certainly on the verge. There is plenty of wood, sawdust, pencil shavings, and peat followed by a bit of ash and smoke as well. This batch is certainly the “non-sweet” side of Ardbeg. Finish: A bit of sweetness (natural raw cane sugar) that quickly dies away . . . now the classic Ardbeg intake of breath . . . here comes the wave of peat, iodine, and salt . . . so slow and long. This is more of a saline solution then the sharp sea spray that Ardbeg usually has. Everything is a bit mellow here (again, oxidization?) Complexity, Balance: Not the most complex on the nose, but very well balanced on the taste and finish . . . almost too balanced for me. I like my Ardbeg with a bit more bite than this. But then, who knows how long I had it opened and oxidizing? Aesthetic experience: Love this bottle. It is just fantastic. 46% is the minimum that it needs to be. It is also NCF and I highly doubt there is ANY color in these bottles. This particular batch is average color; almost the exact color as the L13 241!  Conclusion: This bottle might go back all the way back to 2008 when I opened a bottle of the Beist and Almost There on my birthday (I drank WAY slower in those days). What I can remember is never being impressed with this bottle. It was just standard issue. And now all these years later it is still just an average Ardbeg TEN at best. Older versions are not always better.  Sweet smoky lemons Ardbeg is undoubtedly one of the most well-known and beloved malt whisky distilleries in the world. Founded by Alexander Stewart, Ardbeg’s first record as a distillery dates back to 1794, and commercial production began in 1815. During its long history the distillery was closed down on a number of occasions only to be reopened again by new owners each time. After having been mothballed in 1981 the distillery resumed production in 1989 and continued at a low level through to July 1996 when it closed again until the following year. In 1997 Ardbeg distillery was acquired by Glenmorangie plc (who shortly thereafter were taken over by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and production resumed. The 10-year old expression was introduced in 2000 and has been part of Ardbeg’s core range ever since. Here is the label code, especially for Nock: L14 014 07:01 6ML. The nose is crisp, fresh, salty and lightly smoky. There are plenty of vanilla flavours, together with milky cereal sweetness, brine and hints of lemon. The palate is medium-bodied and just a tad peppery. Lemon, vanilla and salt are at the forefront, until a wave of soft smoke rolls over the tongue. Towards the end distinctly sweet elements such as liquorice and dried fruits emerge. The finish is of medium length, smoky and salty. Smokiness and sweetness are well balanced, with cereal flavours and hints of liquorice making a final appearance. I am a big fan of Ardbeg and I do like almost all expressions, be it the assertive Corryvreckan, the lush Uigeadail, the seductive Airigh Nam Beist – you name it. However, the 10-year old expression lacks the complexity that all of the above-mentioned come with. Is it fresh and fruity? Yes. Is it nicely smoky? Yes. But that is about it. Somehow I would have expected a little bit more depth and character. Ardbeg had been very close to being buried next to Port Ellen and a few other legendary distilleries. The distillery had been mothballed twice in the eighties and nineties. The real salvation came from Glenmorangie (now LVHM). Since the stills were reheated in 1997, Ardbeg's reputation soared like an eagle. Now fans nearly come to blows when they launch special or limited editions.  The core range is rather limited. The Ardbeg Ten is accompanied by two NAS expressions: Uigeagail and Corryvreckan. And that's about it. Every year on May 31th, Ardbeg Day, they launch a new limited edition. And since 2014 is all about the World Cup in Brazil it was named Auriverdes. Tasting Notes Colour: Ardbeg Ten clearly matures exclusively in ex-bourbon casks. It is a light yellow whisky with a sticky texture. The tears slide gracefully down the glass. Nose: Typical Ardbeg peat smoke (makes sense right?) pairs nicely with rubber and used bicycle tires. A sea breeze over the pier combined with sweet vanilla flavours and citrus zest. Further up are associations of tar, blown matches and chlorine. Water releases sweet aromas. Vanilla, black pudding with raisins and smoked bacon with a thin coat of maple syrup. Everything is garnished with some lemon marmalade. Taste: The tongue undergoes a pleasant symbiosis of sweet and salt. Juicy pears with coarse sea salt, freshly picked mint, rosemary and vanilla. Towards the end the smoky and citric flavours return. Adding water to this Ardbeg means adding a little more richness: black pepper, roasted milk bread and grounded coffee. Finish: The black pepper continues through the finish with some star anise. A relatively long finish. Conclusion This was my very first peated whisky nearly two years ago. Saying I wasn't convinced was an understatement at the time. Right now it’ll be more something like “Bring it on !”. These kind of flavour bombs are the reason a (wo)man starts drinking whisky. Ardbeg Ten can be found everywhere. Every supermarket with a decent range or nameworthy liquor store, has it in store. The price has, influenced by demand and duties, risen towards the € 50 mark.

This is a great single malt hall marked with its peat character and it's deep savory richness. Nose: tinge of salt cured meat, savory peat, dirt, citric acid, over ripe almost decaying onion. Caramelized onion. Taste: rich robust smoke as from a barbecue. An onion sweatiness with an ex bourbon chatted sweetness. It's an easy to I obtain classic. Take your time with it and you will receive dividends. I will seek to replace my bottle.  Well... having found this for £37 (44€) in the UK this weekend I decided to go for it. I'm not an advanced drammer by any stretch of the imagination, but being a great fan of HP and Lagavulin I thought I'd see what a heavier peated scotch tasted like. Nose - love it... maritime and oily. Fish? But not quite the silky 'smoked salmon' of the Lagavulin 16... Palate - wow... I get mostly rubber, iodine and dark unsweetened chocolate. Medium to full bodied... I cannot find any of the vanilla or zesty flavours mentioned by many. Finish - moss, iodine & more burnt rubber. I find it hard to get past that rubber for some reason! Makes it hard to really enjoy. For me the finish is far too much about the iodine & burnt rubber than anything else. I just don't get much flavour-complexity out of this. Maybe it will grow on me, but I just don't like it anywhere near as much as the other peated whiskies I've tried, ie. Lag'16 and Laphr 10/15 I will add water with it next time and see what changes... I have to say that this was not my first Islay malt but was my first Ardbeg. I can still remember the nose on this dram. It was a lemony, peaty, vanilla, with an espresso boldness that I can still taste today. From the first nosing this dram had a majesty about it that needed no pre-description. If you love the Islay malts you'll remember the one that got you hooked. This was mine. I could nose this whiskey for hours. The scents of the sea, that fishy/salty smoke, with a peppery-citrus tang and soft vanilla undertone. I cannot think of another Ten year old malt with such depth and diversity. Slainte Mhath!  This is my first review despite 40 years of devotion to my favourite tipple. I started on blends and have matured/graduated from the sweet highlands to the caramel Kirkwall Islands and am now stumbling cheerily through Peaty Islay. I am a huge fan of Laphroaig and Lagavulin. Reviews and thoughts on these will flow later. Ardbeg 10 is my third wonderful discovery and I was a little hesitant after reading mixed reviews but the first breath from the bottle dispelled my fears. I have a hound dog nose and could get a weekend job working with beagles at the airport so I'm told. My descriptors may differ from the more experienced reviewers on this site so here goes. Nose - cool peat smoke like a menthol cigarette. Orange zest crushed and minced with white pepper. Taste - up front I get brined lemon and rock salt. Complexity or at the back is old blackcurrent jam and light ash. Finish - dull over ripe plums and a waft of smoke. Batch L11 011 14.53 6ML I was scared of this single malt and even more scared to write this review until i got a better handling of this beast, Nose: Peat, lemon-lime, dark chocolate, Menthol, black pepper, a hemp like aroma, graphite, smoked salted fish, bacon. Palate:Peat, tangy lemon-lime, black pepper, smoked fish, coffee, bananas, currants. Finish: Smoked Cheddar, smoke, chewy expresso Overall an excellent whisky, i prefer it over laphroaig. Try this and give it a chance and watch as you are amazed by the strength of it. Here’s a little comparison review of an older vs. newer bottle of Ardbeg 10, just to see if any significant changes occurred with this popular dram over a three-year period. I found an older bottle of Ardbeg 10, tucked behind a row of newer bottles, on the shelf at the local store. I recognized the older-style packaging that was discontinued in 2009, so of course I snatched it up. Bottle code is L9 096, which, I believe, is the last batch issued in the U.S. (April 2009, according to the Ardbeg Project website) with the old bottle and packaging. This review will compare that bottle to a 2012 bottling, with a code of L12 071. Maybe there’s not much practical value in comparing two random batches, I’ll admit. And it might prove nothing insofar as the “older=better” debate is concerned. I could have a sensational batch from ’12 and a dud from ’09, after all. So maybe I have no better reason for writing this review than wanting to share my thoughts as I enjoyed these two drams side-by-side. The 2012 bottle is about five months old, down below the halfway mark. Last sampled a couple of months ago, and gassed after doing so. This will be my third dram from the 2009 bottle, opened three days ago. Nose (2012, neat): Stings with earthy peat. A bit of that unpleasant pavement-after-rain smell. Lemons and fresh sea air help balance things. Something sharp and metallic here, and I kind of like the way it kicks you in the nostrils and dares you not to like it. Tames down considerably after a 12-minute sit. Nose (2009, neat): Much, much fresher. No dirty or metallic notes here. The peat and lemons are co-stars here, and a little touch of mint is a new supporting player. No sting, no alcohol, even with the heartiest of whiffs. Palate (2012, neat): Nice and syrupy on arrival, nice oily coating as it sits. Begins rather subtly with vanilla and citrus fruits (or a lime Dreamsicle, if you prefer), followed by a slow-creeping burn of peat and pepper. A fascinating finish comes and goes in waves: just when you think it’s gone, it comes back for yet another encore. Carmel and smoke during the quiet moments, pepper and smoke during the crescendos. Palate (2009, neat): Yes, this is a very different beast. Smooth as butter on silk, even if that smoothness compensates for some lack of balance. (But then, whoever praised Ardbeg 10 for its balance?) More tame and watery in the arrival than the ’12, and the development is much slower, but the same heat and peppers show up eventually. No back-and-forth finish here; it’s steady, long-lasting, but mild—and with much more wood. The wood turns sticky and sappy after about a minute. Even at a rather healthy 49% ABV, I prefer Ardbeg 10 neat. But I also enjoy its changes after a few drops of water. Just a few, please. It’s a lousy swimmer and drowns easily. Nose (2012, with water): A strong vanilla note, absent before. The vanilla almost dominates now, in fact, as the neat aromas become soft whispers. The peat makes a major resurgence after a 10-minute wait. Nose (2009, with water): Same as the 2012, only less so. The vanilla is tamer, the other aromas near-invisible, and the traces of peat are slightly dirtier. Overall, however, there’s a bright freshness to it that’s something of a face-slapper in itself. Palate (2012, with water): Eerily like the neat 2009. Quiet, neutral arrival, followed by some peppery sting. A little more vanilla overall. Some wood, no longer exclusive to the ’09, appears in the finish. Palate (2009, with water): Two or three drops of water really make a difference in this one. A creamy balance of vanilla and peat on the arrival, with a much more interesting burn (peat, pepper, lemons and limes) as it develops. The finish is more clipped, but it’s full of some nice vanilla and oak. Nothing but pure peat at the fadeout. Yum. Hmmm…I guess I didn’t prove much beyond the difference in two each-in-its-own-way tasty batches. And that you should nose and drink both neat, although be sure to have a couple of sips of the ’09 with a little water. And that I probably didn’t mention “peat” in this review as often as I should have. On most nights, I’d give a 90 to both, but I’m in a generous mood tonight. This will be my first review, been drinking whisky for soon a year now. Actually started my spirit journey alltogether about a year ago. My first love was Jack Daniels Old no7, now i think its average, but still good. My taste has gravitated to more heavy stuff, islays, cask strength whiskys and brandys. Nose: Nosed from a brandy balloon. Matchbox, ash, candlewax, dirt, oak, white wine. Palate: Same as nose. Pasta, very sweet-sugary, some vanilla and citrus. Finish: Peatsmoke, wax, licoricy, slight dirt and green apple skin. Coats ure mouth and last long. This whisky sorts of taste like a bourbon highland malt with islay heavy peat, i like the laphroaigs ive tasted better(quarter+10yo) where the style of the malt suits the peat better. Laphroaig is more musty/funky in the overall taste, while Ardbeg TEN have that clean highland taste to it in addition to the peat. Not much complexity, but still a very good whisky if u like that heavy islay peat. Nose: Sweet maritime peat greets your nose. Wood chips and splinters, sea salt, seaweed, and wet rocks dominate the middle of the nose. After you get past the peat smoke you can pick up the citric lemon acid tinges to the whole. Definitely lemon zest mixed with maritime peat. It is an austere peat; not the deep complex peat of Lagavulin nor the muddy and iodine peat of Laphroaig. It makes you thing of old leather chairs, bits of wood by the fireplace, and a smoldering peat fire. This is a coastal boat trip with a peat fired engine. However, there is also a bit of that citrus lemon oil from the peel going on here. Light citrus hovers over the peat bog: lemon zest trimming the bog just like the golden celtic knot trims the dark label and bottle. Truly this smells like the bottle looks . . . love it! And the smoke . . . it undergirds everything here. You don’t even notice it because it is in the background. With water – more peat and lemon. Also there is a bit of chocolate that emerges. It actually took water rather well. I like it quite a bit. No change in score.  Taste: Light gold peat on the tongue. Semi-sweet peat with a notes of vanilla, sea salt, seaweed paper, and a hint of iodine on the back. There is lemon rind mixed with peat and a nice pinch of sea salt on top of a bead of cooked seaweed. Also, a hint of oak with plenty of smoke in the background. The slightly bitter earth balances nicely with the slightly sweet peat. = 5.5 Finish: Big Ardbeg intake of breath along with that searing hot salt water . . . but no big wave. Interesting. Big dollop of peat, moss, dark earth, tree bark, oak, and smoke. There is also plenty of that seaweed paper, spicy red pepper, and some of that lemon rind zing. Lovely and lingering.  Complexity, Balance: Very complex . . . for a 10yo. This does an amazing balance of the peat and the lemon, the maritime and the bonfire. The balance of sweet peat to sour citrus, bitter dark earth to spices; smoke to seaweed is amazing. It delivers what it promises on the nose. Really complex, refined and balanced on the nose. That alone gets it into a top running. It is a study in complexity and balance: it doesn’t seem like a peat bruiser a mouth destroyer, nor is it passive and gentile. It is everything I want in a single malt. The only thing keeping it from perfection in my book is that it lacks those extra crazy elements (like old Ardbegs, and Broras) that cause you to be amazed at its depth. Not quite there . . . but then it is only 10 years old . . . and for a 10yo it is amazing!  Aesthetic experience: Slightly more straw and lighter color then the L13 003. Love this bottle (and this batch). I love the label, the shape, the color, the ABV, the ncf, and the traditional “A.” If only I could find more bottles like this one!  Nose: Peat, lime, cream and vanilla. The vanilla suggests a vatting of very fresh ex-bourbon casks (in this case from Jack Daniels). The citrus is stronger and more astringent then what I consider typical Ardbeg. I would say more on the lime side then the lemon side of things. And there is this soft creaminess to the nose as opposed to the dark bog you can often get. The peat is much more in the background covered up by the citrus and vanilla. Smoke is creeping out around the edges. I know after some time this will get smokier. Sweet vanilla and lime cream with smoke and salted capers. Strong sweetness from the vanilla is almost a high tenor in tone.
Water really dampens the vanilla and brings up the peat smoke. Still plenty strong. Decent standard Ardbeg nose with peat smoke and citrus. Nothing deep, mind blowing, or amazing. Taste: Nice creamy vanilla and lime mixed with peat; now some smoke and capers are coming out. An alder plank smoked trout with caper berries! A little more rounded then I like my Ardbeg TEN. Finish: Nice Ardbeg intake of breath . . . here comes the wave of sea salt and peat. Medium to medium low wave. Not the big Uigeadail, Corry, or Supernova tidal wave I have come to love. A decent finish all things told. Nothing overwhelming; but still Ardbegy. The creamy lime really leaves a mark. Not my favorite “new” Ardbeg tone. Complexity, Balance: Decent balance for the 10yo. Not the most complex by any means, but about what you would expect from a standard 10yo. The problem is I have come to expect WAY more from Ardbeg then this is showing. Aesthetic experience: Very light straw color. I love the label, the shape, the color of the bottle, the ABV, the ncf, and the traditional “A.""  Over the next while, interspersed with other reviews, I'll be revisiting some standard, entry-level single malt expressions that I haven't written on before (but that I've mostly tasted in bars, at parties, etc). Many of you may find this exercise boring but I find it very interesting; it's always good to revisit an old friend (or nemesis) with fresh eyes (or a fresh palate, as the case may be). In this case, we have one of my favourites. Ardbeg 10 Year Old as been part of their stable for a very long time, but the current variant came out in 2008, ten years after Glenmorangie acquired the distillery. In other words, Dr. Bill had full control over this spirit. The colour is an extremely pale yellow, like very weak tea. On the nose there is a liquorice sweetness, with tart green apples, tar, damp campfire, lemon/lime, and lots of briny sea spray. More peaty and robust with a drop of water. The complexity of the sweet/peat combination is astounding, especially in an entry-level expression such as this. I could nose this forever. On the palate, there is more brine but again, it is surprisingly sweet and malty. Pears, bandages, more lemon/lime. Dried grasses in a field. Sardines on saltines. White pepper and a touch of mint. Water brings about a creamier mouthfeel and a bit more peat and spice. Wonderfully delicious. On the finish there are deeper spices, and low waves of rolling peat smoke. This may very well be the greatest of all entry-level single malts, with complexity, vibrancy and excitement. It's too bad it is so expensive - in Ontario this is $100! - but I suppose this is now a luxury product, since being acquired by LVMH. FYI this is a huge Jim Murray favourite, scoring 97 and winning World Whisky of the Year in 2008. Knowing each and every one of you has tried this scotch, I hope I haven't bored you too much! I love Islay malt, my love for them is almost unconditional, than why do I not like this peaty monster? I'm still not sure why and will surely try another dram of the 10 yo in the near future to make sure it wasn't a just a bad batch. But all I can say so far that it was a disappointing experience that just burned in my mouth but little to no flavour to restore the balance. I tried this one at the bar and liked it enough to buy it the next day. I prefer Caol Ila 12 when compared to this one, because it has more flavor. Since I won't be buying this one again, I keep it on hand to spice up any future purchases that wind up being uneventful by adding only a few drops of this Ardbeg 10 (God forbid!!!). Adding any more than a few drops will just obliterate whatever is the main malt, trust me on this. This may be due to the relatively high alcohol contact, but not quite cask strength. I would imagine that a couple of drops of this added to Glenlivet 12 may really work well. After the distillery being mothballed in 1983, this whisky here really shows what a long way they've come. This was my second Ardbeg after having had the privilege of tasting a 1993 single cask as my first 9 years ago. And it was glorious, the Ten year old i mean ;) Now i am revisiting this Islay gem.  Nose: A vanilla surge then swiftly followed by a creamy vanilla/peat burst that goes on and on. Seashores, seashells and salty seabursts rounds everything off with a strong (yet not imposing)Citrus in the background since the beggining till the end. Palate: As with the nose it's the vanilla that makes the intro for the fanfare, although a sweeter vanilla, that then subsides by a more familiar creamy vanilla making leave for the creamy zesty peat that then caps out with smoke all over the tastebuds. Still Great this dram, oh Boy! The development is dominated by a complex creamy lemon and citrus note that grows more and more complex with peat, holding on alongside it, with the smoke. Rounding off with a finish or rather an ""encore"", or even ""encore-fanfare"" of sorts, with the vanilla, peat, citrus-lemon and this time with added peppers (lime-pepper?) don't know for sure, but what i do know is this that used to be such a good whisky, very much still is... just that. Great Ardbeg 10. Not much intro needed so let's get into it.  Nose: Peat, Dish Soap, Lime, Salt, Creamed Corn  Palate: Big Peat, Sweet Smoke, Fairly Smooth and Oily, Orange Marmalade, Pepper Jack Cheese Finish: Shorter than I expected. Peat, Orange Zest, Charcoal I liked it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy Caol Ila 12, Lagavulin 12 or Lagavulin 16, but that's ok. A solid whisky that everyone should try at least once.  Comments (0) Ardbeg 10. Not much intro needed so let's get into it.  Nose: Peat, Dish Soap, Lime, Salt, Creamed Corn Palate: Big Peat, Sweet Smoke, Fairly Smooth and Oily, Orange Marmalade, Pepper Jack Cheese Finish: Shorter than expected. Peat, Orange Zest, Charcoal.  I liked it. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy Caol Ila 12, Lagavulin 12 or Lagavulin 16, but that's ok. A solid whisky that everyone should try at least once.  Since this is one of the most reviewed whiskies around, I don't need any technical details to accompany this review, so I'll just jump right in. Nose: Smoke, citrus, salt and some wisps of vanilla. Campfire doesn't really apply to the nose in my opinion. It seems closer to an industrial smokestack than anything else. Intense, peaty. Palate: The smoke on the palate is closer to a campfire than the industrial smoke from the nose would suggest. Very medicinal. A little bit of sweet honey. Finish: Smoke. Ash. Long, intense smoke. I'm disappointed. This whisky is so beloved by so many. It's intense, yes. But it's not complex. There's more complexity in the similarly priced Laphroaig QC, the Laddie 10, the Talisker 10, and even the lesser Bowmores. I haven't tried much from Ardbeg. And, no, I haven't tried the Uigeadail. And, yes, I'd love to give it a shot. But this is just a blast of smoke without a lot else going on. There are some lesser notes here, but not many. The ones that are seem so overwhelmed by the smoke that they're almost imperceptible. It's balanced and smooth, but it's just too damn simple. Not bad, but not something I'll be buying again despite the reasonable price. Then again, if you're a peathead who isn't in the mood for contemplation and you want a straight-forward daily dram, this is for you. The Ardbeg 10 is an old friend that I have had a few bottles of over the years. It is one of those expressions that an Islay lover like me keeps around consistently in the cabinet. Partially because the pricetag is friendly enough that I can feel semi-comfortable putting it on a holiday gift list if/when someone asks. I love my peat, and Ardbeg is never shy about it. This 10 Year is no exception. Most whiskies are chill-filtered and reduced to a strength of around 40% ABV. The Ardbeg Ten Years Old, however, is non chill-filtered and has a strength of 46% ABV.  The color of this Scotch is always surprising to me as it is so light. Even drinking it by candlelight, it is still bright like a white wine. Looks can be deceiving though…as this drink is no lightweight. Nose: Peat and pungent smoke at first, a plume that needs to escape. The second whiff is where the ocean and sweetness come in. The sweet is tart like lemons. The briny oceanic tints nestle within the peat…think smoked salmon. Palate: Sweet citrus up front, and crisp. Oily, with lots of seaweed and brine before the peat comes back for round two. The smoke is heavier this time, more tar-like. Somehow the whole experience is balanced and smooth despite the peat not being fully tamed. Finish: Salty dryness. The finish is long, and the smoke smolders like a reluctant campfire that refuses to be snuffed out. Conclusion This is for a peat fan and I am an admitted member of the Ardbeg Committee, as I always have one on my shelf. Those that favor the sherried floral drams will likely be a little turned off at first. I always loved revisiting my Glencairn glass the next day with this one. I have intentionally left it out near the sink just so I can smell it the next morning, and the smokiness fills the kitchen. For an Islay fan I have to consider this one for the ‘bang for the buck’ list I will be putting together. But, I digress, the bottom line here is that it is spicy, sweet, and oh so smoky. If you can take a peaty punch in the chin, and can handle the distinctive Ardbeg smoke, you are going to like this one. Peat and more peat plus a little smoke and some sweetness on the nose. Neat palate is peat, some sweetness, and a bit medicinal. Finish is peat and a little sweetness, quickly dominated by BandAids. The BandAid finish goes on for hours. I tasted it the next morning. Adding water increases the BandAid palate and finish. That was my experience. I admit to being a Islay newbie. How can something be so good, yet so bad for you? Ardbeg 10 year old captures the true essence of whisky for you. Like many of the Ardbeg range, it gives you feelings of pure enjoyment in a tough palate. It's your real life Devil's Advocate. Ardbeg 10 is like John Milton a.k.a the Beelsebub, played by Al Pacino. Giving you all you want but wanting something in return. And every time I drink Ardbeg 10, I don't mind giving something away. Whether it's my liver or my brain cells, just be my guest, take it! I'd say that these two have similarities in acknowledgment too. Devil's Advocate got 7.4/10 pts in the Internet Movie Database, which is a good score in there. But I'd still say that it's not generally so highly appreciated. Ardbeg 10 got Jim Murray's 'Whisky of the Year' award in 2008 but based on reviews and my whisky friends thoughts, it's not as popular as some of the other Ardbegs. Only thing that separates these two is that while The Devil's Advocate plot needed some heavy thinking, Ardbeg 10 is not that complex. It's a straight whisky, though it balances well between sweet and smoke. Just like Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) balances between bad and good.  Nose: Starts with a touch of vanilla which introduces you to strong and heavy peat with citrus salt. Taste: Just a great balance of sweetness and smoke. Vanilla is mixed with lemon and followed by heavy smoke. Finish: Sea salted smoke with hints of caramel. And did I say it's long? Yes, loooong. Balance: This is one of the best balanced whiskies I've tasted. When I first tasted Ardbeg 10 it was with great expectations. I'm a huge fan of Laphroaig and Caol Ila, with both hail from Islay, like Ardbeg. I was correct in assuming Ardbeg 10 would have a similar heavy peat-smoke-fire smell and taste! It was the distinct Islay quality I had come to recognize. But compared to Laphroaig and Caol Ila, it felt noticeably weaker. I sipped a bit of Laphroaig directly after the Ardbeg, and found that indeed the Laphroaig was far more intense. This extra intensity of body may not be to everyone's liking, however! So if you like the Islay peat smoke, but don't really like the punch-you-in-the-face intensity, go with Ardbeg! It's still an amazing scotch, and more intense than most other single malts apart from the other Islays. Ardbeg 10 is a much reviewed Whisky. I have no expectations on saying anything new or revolutionary.  The nose is soft yet full, Smokey, salty sea spray with a whiff of burnt bacon. There is a lemon undertone which is covered by a powerful peat aroma. Your first taste brings strong Smoke, fruit, sweet spices with a smooth oily texture. This is a rich peaty punch with a sales caramel flavour. It has a long finish which leaves the tongue tingling and the mouth wanting more. As an experience it is something you want to last. If you haven't tried it buy a bottle! Pound for pound this is a a serious contender. I can't think of anything for the same money that delivers such flavour, quality, complexity and class. After reading so many reviews, about how good this whisky is, I had to try it for myself. Upon opening the bottle strong smell of peat smacks my face and my wife's, who is 15ft away from me. She thought I brought in our Medicine box/container, which actually smells just like my Ardbeg 10. On the palate it is not as heavily peated as the nose would suggest. It is quiet nice,,, hints of orange peel, citrus notes, hint of toffee, and some kind of sweetness in the end. and of course loads of peat and smoke, iodine.... Overall I really enjoy this whisky. I guess my journey to Islay whisky started on the right foot. I also have an un-opend bottle of Uigeadail that im dying to try out  Caol Ila was more peppery and a bit more cantankerous in a good way. Quite a few similarities. Both drams had their own strengths.  I must say that the creosote-like hints in Ardbeg were not ideal. There is a taste that reminds me of diesel fumes and creosote. It's faint but there.  The Ardbeg had a wide variety of flavors, perhaps wider than the Caol Ila, and I liked the hose on the Ardbeg more for sure. Even though Caol Ila is created right by the water, Ardbeg did remind me of the sea quite a bit more, which is nice. A little seaweed and ocean brine crept in there, which I did not detect as much in the Caol Ila.  I had a glass of both up on the bar and gave them a thorough comparison.  Caol Ila 12 wins at 88 points. Two more than the Ardbeg 10. Both are delicious but the creosote and diesel hints in the Ardbeg palette just don't quite work for me. Despite this short-coming, I still liked it a great deal, however, despite the ""industrial"" aspect to it, which the Caol Ila did not have. Standard-Arden som förmodligen är den bästa islayen i den kategorin. The most incredible thing of this whisky is its sea-salt nose. When I first opened the bottle I spent an half hour smelling the cork, adsorbing that beatiful smell of enraged sea, feeling as I was there on top of a lighthouse looking out towards the ocean on a stormy day. The score given just reflect the fact that I didn't yet taste more exclusive Ardbeg bottles which I expect will considerably improve my experience I just've started my journey into the wonderous world of whisky. The better whiskies that is. The whiskies that I'm known with, are Vat 69, Glennfiddisch 12 y.o., Jack Daniels, Johnny Walker Green Label and I recently purchased the very nice Auchentoshan Three Wood, which I really enjoy. But since I only have the Three Wood in my cabinet, I decided to go to my local whiskyshop, to purchase the Ardbeg 10 y.o. because of the fantastic reviews it gets on Whisky Connosr, and I wanted to try something different besides the Three Wood. And boy, do I regret my purchase. Let me tell you why: The Nose: This is where it started. When I poured myself a glass, the aroma of bandaids, jodium, medicinal stuff entered my nose. And shivres ran across my spine. I absolutely don't like this welcome-commitee. But when I got used to the smell, I started to smell things like thick black smoke, and burned wood. Also not very pleasant to me. The Pallet: All those things I just mentioned, came back with a vengeance. The very high peat-levels in this whisky is something you love or you hate. Maybe it is something you must learn to drink, and something I can enjoy when I am a somewhat more experienced whisky-lover, but for now I found it to be an awfull taste. The finish: This was actually pretty long. And when the medicinal taste was gone, it started to taste somewhat like when you have smoked a cigarette. But since I don't smoke (have tried it a couple of times in the past when I was younger) this definitely wasn't my cup of tea either. I am going to keep this bottle in my cabinet untill the day comes, when I can appreciate a highly peated whisky like this one. For now, my search for great whiskies I love continues... taken from furtias.blogspot.com.es/2012/12/… Aged for ten years in Bourbon casks and bottled at 46%ABV. TASTING NOTES Color: Straw. Nose: Peaty, smoky and coastal. Very ""Ardbeg"". Seaweed, iodine, soil, seashells, cider, pepper.  Taste: Powerful and medicinal. Sweeter at first (malty sweetness in fact), then moody. Seawater, seaweeds, burning peat's smoke and some lemon. Finish: Long,medicinal and warming with lots of smoke and iodine. Totally inside a stereotypical Ardbeg's boundaries.  Being a whisky noob I haven't had many opportunities to try different whiskies. Out of those that I've sampled, I found that I enjoyed more the delicate and rich whiskies than the smoky/peated whiskies. I received this bottle as a Christmas present from my father and was worried that it would go to waste seeing that it didn't fit my taste profile. What a surprise, I really enjoyed this! Although it has a heavy peated taste, I found it to be balanced and enjoyable on the palate. I found myself refilling my glass more than once on my first sampling! I thoroughly enjoy Ralfy.com's reviews and as Ralfy said, a peat smoke bomb, like sticking your head in a bonfire! I agree and it just goes to show you, even when your convinced something is not for you, go ahead and try it anyways, you just might find out something new about yourself! Enjoy fellow Malt Monsters ;)  Ardbeg has a reputation of being a very peaty Whisky and one of the finest representations of Islay style single malts. What I would say distinguishes Ardbeg from other Islay Malts is it's well balanced structure. It is a Whisky that perfectly balances strong Islay character with other more soothing notes. It is complex, while delivering just enough intensity to be enjoyable and not overbearing. The Ardbeg 10 y.o. is a perfect example of such a perfectly balanced profile.  Nose: Phenolic tones, peaty, earthy, tones. The nose has brine, sea salt, lots of smoke, burning wood (a bonfire), charcoal, iodine, sea spray, petrol. All these are strong smells but then it also has more gentle notes of lemon zest, orange rinds, roasted coffee, butter, and cream. If you add a cooling Whisky stone you get more intense butter, fresh bread, and bread dough.  Palate: Cream followed by peat and peppers, smoke, clove, sea weed, citrus. Big body, heavy, and thick. The peaty peppers are quite a lasting presence on the palate but they do eventually fade. Once this happens the previously mentioned flavors return. Finish: Oily all the way through a long finish. Very smokey, butter, bitter herbal tea. The charcoal is very prominent in the finish. Very slight heat showing up once in awhile from sip to sip.  Overall, I enjoy the contrasting smells on the nose and the appearance of very strong tastes of peaty and peppers in the palate that are contrasted by cream and butter. The contrasting nose and taste make this Whisky interesting and complex. They balance beautifully instead of conflicting with each other. This in my opinion, is what makes Ardbeg a complex and well balanced Whisky. Two seemingly contradictory smells and flavors that balance each other out instead of compete with each other. Very nice dram.  Full bodied, warm, earthy peated blast. Long slow textured finish. How can one distillery go through, what is fundamentally, the same process and produce expressions that are miles ahead of everyone else? The standard Ardbeg 10 is anything but. Like a young savant it hides the most complex of personalities yet remains buoyantly youthful. As the tangy smoke rises from delicately grilled lemon zest roasting on the grill the chef brushes the main course of sausages with his own brand of special butter glaze. The sweetened smoky peat, mixed with a touch of tincture, remind you where this savant was born. The palate is like eating a soft pudding under a haze of powdery volcanic ash. I never thought words like tar, soot and tobacco could be used to describe something so utterly scrumptious but then I've been proven wrong many a time. A juicy, brightly colored orange kicks in at the last instant re-affirming the massive complexities that lie in this delivery. Smoked bitter gourd, a touch of medicine, tiny oak shavings and a toss of minty leaves finishes up one of the nicest and longest deliveries that have ever had the pleasure of cascading down my fortunate gullet. When I was beginning to explore the single-malt world, I hadn't yet worked my way up to the Peat Giants of Islay when I was introduced by a friend to Ardbeg. Yikes! My first impression was that of a dead pine forest slathered with a layer of Vicks Vapo Rub. But, as they say, it's like hot peppers: at first you gag, then you learn to appreciate the experience, then you love the taste. Even if, just as with the peppers, you still gag occasionally. I'd never start the evening with Ardbeg, but I love this big, gutsy whisky. Can't believe I haven't tried the Uigeadail yet, but I plan to invest in a bottle when my supply of 10 yo gets down to a few drams. This whisky just flat out reminds me of my grandfather. He was a crofter and a peat cutter. I've tried this before and wasn't reminded of him at all but now i can't shake it...strange. Nose: Fresh cut peat, some pipe-smoke; fascinating how the peat and the pipe-smoke can seem so distinct.There seems to be oranges in there too. Mouth: Peaty like half-burnt clods, peat that went onto the fire late and didn't take properly. Now you're taking it off the day after. Behind that is all sorts maybe even chocolate liquorice? Citrus hints again. One or two pleasing burnt notes. Burnt bacon? After: Give up all that violence to a mild, warming finish. It's beyond all belief that such an aggressive whisky should end so politely. A masterpiece. First bottle of Islay, reviewing after having it a week and and a dozen drams. Love the bottle, screams ""I am Scotch! drink me!"" Color is very pale and heavy. Nose: First sweet brine, salted nuts, butter-cream, malt and a little pear. Very pleasing Taste: As soon as it hits the tongue sweet butter-cream up front turning into a smooth, smokey peat and dry salt water with pepper keeping some sweetness from the butter-cream the whole way through. Complexity: You could try to pinpoint flavors all day, each time I have had this a taste other characters and depth. Finish: Very smooth, much smoother than you think its going to be, leaving a pleasant, creamy, smokey brine flavor that is dry making you want more.  My wife and I had gone to Helvetica for a series of whisky and chocolate tastings and we'd finally progressed to the last pairing of the night.  Now this last whisky to be tasted with a chocolate was a whisky that most people would likely think wouldn't be a good whisky for it. I know I was semi skeptical. That whisky was Ardbeg. Specifically Ardbeg 10 yr old. Now I'd had quite a few different expressions of Ardbeg over the last year or so, but I'd yet to try the 10 yr old so I was pretty curious. I was even more curious how well it would pair up with the chocolate. Especially considering that the chocolate was to be malt balls or malteses as I believe they're known in the land down under. For the record I REALLY don't like malt balls. Like REALLY don't like. But first off, let's see this whisky that has everyone talking! So I take the tasting glass and start to nose around and the very first thing that hits me is peat, lots of peat and smoke, almost bonfire type smoke, but at no point does it kill the nose for me, rather it almost enhances the other aromas coming from my glass. Underneath the smoke and peat is a sweetness. Smells a bit like pears and pineapples, vanilla, possibly a bit of apple in there, and along with this lovely sweetness is the always present aroma of burnt band aids and iodine. A very awesome nose that instantly takes me the isle of Islay and Ardbeg! I decide to finally take my first sip of Ardbeg 10 yr old. Now I've tried quite a few Ardbegs before, Renaissance, Corryvreckan, Uigeadail and the mythical Lord of the Isles.  So I had a fair idea of what to expect flavor wise and I wasn't disappointed! The smoke, peat, iodine are all immediately evident in the mouth, but underneath all of that the pears say hello to everyone in the room to. A very very yummy whisky! Pepper appears in the mouth with a small bit of kick and spice, but not unpleasantly so. The finish is long with a smokey flavor and a bit of pepper giving you a kick in the face as it goes down. Quite yum as I have said before! But as much as I love my whisky, the point of this entire visit is to try the pairing of whisky and chocolate. Now the little page we're given when we arrived said that the malt in the chocolate that we're trying with this whisky, the malt balls. Now I take a sip of the Ardbeg and take a cautious bite of the malt balls. And the flavors EXPLODE in my mouth! It's this lovely perfect combination that does indeed bring out the malt inside the whisky and the malt balls in a way that enhances the best flavors of the whisky and the chocolate.  The only way I can describe it is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! Now the tasting notes we were given suggests cracking the malt balls open and sucking the Ardbeg through it. My wife does this after having just tried the malt balls and whisky together and says that this way of drinking the whisky is even better. She actually describes it as lovely. This is coming from someone who while will try smokey and peaty whiskies, will not drink them again once she has tried it. I attempt to do this, but I seem to be having some problems. This is probably due to the fact that I'm a bit of a troll and an utter klutz with anything non animal related. Damn it! I try and try to manage this cracking of the malt balls and drinking the Ardbeg through it, but sadly I have no success. Doesn't matter.  Brilliant pairing! Even better is that Ardbeg 10 yr old is an easily accessible whisky over here in Australia and retails for anywhere from $85 to $110 dollars!  Not too bad! Now this was supposed to be the end of the night, but not for us!  We aren't able to get out here often enough and I'd love to try the new Ardbeg Day whisky and I haven't tried my George T Stagg so we shall be a little while longer! As before the whisky review score can be found down below while the chocolate and whisky pairing score is found right here. Ardbeg 10 yr old and Malt Balls 94/100  Nose: Creamy smokiness, zesty tang of lemon and limes, earthiness, strong peat, slight saltiness. Palate: Oily, buttermilk, strong expresso milk coffee, burnt toast, peat and smoke builds, keeps a creaminess, slight notes of dried pears and banana, some spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. Finish: smoky earthiness, milky coffee, slight roasted nuttiness and roasted maltyness, soft peatyness.  This review isn't going to focus on the particular flavours or aromas of Ardbeg. No. This is more than that, this is about how a great whisky can make you feel.... To add some context, yesterday I had a massive meeting with work. A huge meeting. Since starting my new job, the last couple of months had been building up to this one moment (well three long hours of moments). Anyway, it went well. My bosses took me straight out for a couple of pints. After that, I'd got the taste.  There was nothing I wanted to do more than pick up a paper and settle down in one of my favourite bars in Manchester's Northern Quarter (Common for the initiated). When at the bar ordering my second pint there and a bite to eat, like a shining beacon I noticed the Ardbeg 10 on their top shelf. That was it, I was all over it like a bad rash. Now, obviously I've had Ardbeg 10 before on many occasions and, as a rule, I prefer the Uigeadail. It just has more complexity and variety on the palate, with the added punch of being at cask strength. But in this moment, in this setting, in this mood....I've never had anything better in my mouth than that Ardbeg 10. Wow. Thank you Ardbeg. I love you. This is one of the first single malts i have ever tasted. I love all ardbegs, creamy and oily with a straw like color and a taste of the ocean. Nose: some smoke, some burnt wood, rubber notes- reminds me of band aids on the nose! a little hint of pear and apple. faint notes of pineapple too. i could smell the ocean on this one. Palate: salty, smoke turkey bacon with a medicinal character i cannot fully describe but very enjoyable. yummy clams and oyster's I""m getting hungry here. oh yeah tar and pencil like flavors. Finish: Very long and dry, mouth coating. it leaves a long lasting tingle in the mouth, even a sip of lager beer could not flush away this big islay malt. it hangs in there long and strong! lovely. Does the world really need more reviews of popular young whisky? Definitely not, but I need practice writing reviews so I suppose you'll have to suffer through it. And, this being my first review, please be gentle. Nose: Iodine (called ""medicine"" by some) is the immediate full on aroma. Then follows earth, smoke, and sea spray. One has to work a bit at getting more, but below the surface is the sweet bit with papaya, pineapple, and sweet vanilla all making cameos. Palate: Much like the nose with Iodine, smoke, salt, a bit of white pepper, and vanilla. Body: Quite thick on the tongue. Not exactly oily, but one respects the fact that this is nowhere close to thin. Finish: This is the star of the show. Very long. Iodine is certainly present along with a bit of smoke and an ever so faint reminder of sugar. But the best part of the dram follows as one spends the evening dramming it up, slowly, inexorably, the finish turns to full on white sugar with the Iodine taking second fiddle. I am reminded of my childhood when I had numerous bouts with strep throat. My mother would take a spoon of sugar and sprinkle it with a few drops of Balsam de Malta. For those too young to remember, this stuff was horrid, but as time went on the terrible taste faded, and all I was left with was sweetness in the mouth. Such is an evening with this whisky. I think anyone who simply ""tastes"" it would highly undervalue the component never gotten to. So there it is. Forgive me if my nose and palate do not pick up things as a pro would, but having said that, I recently read a review by Serge where he mentioned mustard seed as an aromatic component. I've been around mustard seed a lot. It is absolutely odorless. Nose: Obviously peaty and underpinned with bonfire smoke. A depth of oil and tar with a raw grassy/hay tinge. Above this floats a nuttiness and scents of dried fruit and candied peel, maybe marmalade and vanilla. All this rambling can basically be summed up by saying that this is really complex nose. Palate: More peat and smoke, but it refuses to overwhelm. All sorts going on here with an exciting tang, saltiness and peppery spice; good depth and complexity that keeps you coming back. Finish: after the relative intensity of the whisky so far, the finish is a deliciously calm postlude of warming smoke. The transition from mid-palate to finish is fantastic. Generally very good; but this whisky gets such rave reviews that maybe my expectations of it were too high and it didn't blow my socks off the way I thought it would...there are other peaty whiskies that I prefer, but this is really very good. The standard Ardbeg the 'King of Peat', the 10 years old. After I tried, his fresher brother the 'Blasda' I want more Ardbeg, so I send here my review of the wonderful Ardbeg 10 yo.  Nose: Strongly wonderful peat with great smokey elements, a fantastic palate of citrus fruits and a good background fragrance of milky Belgian chocolate bonbons.  Taste: With a little splash of water, it is just a pleasant and a joy to take a sip of this Godly Scottisch Spirit, lightly smoky, heavenly peat, citrus/lemon fruits and a light taste of sweet enjoyment. Chocolate, and a good strongly delightfull coffee aftertaste... Finish: Long, devine lightly milk chocolate, espresso coffee, with pear and apple fruit...Still the great peat is on the background. Just a few words from me....Fabulous, Gorgeous, Wonderful, Devine and Superb!!! Totally HIGHLY Recommended. Surely for Peat-Lovers! This is a very funny scotch. Incredibly powerful peat and smoke notes, and an oily mouth feel with a smoky finish. But what's interesting about it is that's all there is. As far as flavor profile is concerned, it's pretty thin. After that lead-in, you might think my overall review would be negative, but it's not. This is a really nice bottle, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into (it falls in the same category as the Macallan Cask Strength in that regard). If you're looking for a heavy load of really great peat flavor, this is a fantastic scotch. And the Ardbeg does it better than many others -- it manages not to be either overwrought, abrasive, or too strong. You can find other Islays (my favorite being the Lagavulin 16yo) that can bring more to the table than the Ardbeg 10yo -- a richer flavor profile, more going on than just peat, salt, and smoke. But you don't have to, and there are many times where a glass of this is exactly what I have in mind. Nose: Immediate peat and sea water, medicinal qualities of course, fried applewood bacon, juicy lemon, sage and browned butter. There's also some grapefruit and blackberries that save this from being too one-dimensional. Water brings out some floral notes. Taste: Warming with burning wood, salt and lime, sea water. Not as peaty as the nose suggests, but of course, still present. It has a wonderfully buttery mouthfeel. Finish: Smoke, bitter citrus, herbal qualities and plenty of peat.  This is certainly a classic example of Islay and Ardbeg, however, I wish the peat had a bit more impact on the palate. My favorite is those tart, fruity notes on the nose that mingle with the smoke and peat. Also, compared with the high strength Uigeadail, Corryvrecken, and Alligator, the 10 year old lacks a little on the delivery. No matter though, still wonderful.  My first review in a long time. The palate always surprises: been off whisky for months, particularly Islay smokey, peat flavoured whiskies. Recently, with the advent of autumn, Irish and Scotch whiskies have come back into my world. I started drinking scotch again, with the Johnnie Walker Green, then the Bowmore, which gave me a subtle introduction to Islay malts again. Tonight, I ventured out to my favourite pub for a couple of drinks and dinner. I had a nice Redbreast before I left. At the pub, I noticed they had a bottle of Ardbeg, so I decided to finally give it a try. The nose is particularly smoke and peat, and I thought: ""Here I go with the Laphroaig experience again. I shared the nose of the whisky with the waiter, a great fellow who's company I have come to enjoy a lot. His description was ""Like and old leather purse."" I nosed it again and, yes, the old leather smell came through, along with vast amounts of peat and smoke, at least to me. Then...the first sip, and I was hooked. The smoke and peat rapidly turned into a wonderfully smooth sweetness, with a wonderful, subtle overtone of peat and smoke. Then, the finish: an almost peppery, spicey burn in my mouth, sweet and also dry at the same time. It made me crave more! I had a second double with my meal, and told my friend that I was going to get a bottle after dinner. Which I did, and now I am enjoying in the comfort of home, Sorry to ramble on, but you haven't heard from me in a long time, and I simple cannot say enough about this wonderful stuff. Easily the most interesting whisky I have ever tasted. The big surprise is, that I can keep on drinking it. Most other whiskies, I need to stop at two or three. This is almost a whisky that, if somebody asked me ""What would be your dream scotch whisky or single malt?"", I would come up with the answer ""A blend of super smooth Highland blended with a peatie, smokey Islay."" It is not particularly thick and syrupy, and is a very light, straw-like colour, normally the opposite of what I really like. My favourite single malt to this point, has been either the Glendronach 12 year or the Glengoyne 10 year which, I might add, is triple distilled for a wonderful smoothness. If I had taken the Glengoyne and the Laphroaig and blended them myself, the Ardbeg is possibly what I might have hoped to achieve. The big Surprise is that, in fact, it is a lot better than what I could ever have imagined! Cheers, Carl Smell : grassy almost floral , reminds me of a meadow in the morning over looking the sea. The waves of salt spray whisping of sweet pungent spice. Colour : Pale golden straw Taste: A brief second of delicate light floral lemon grass flavour then growing in complexity of smoke , sweet , salty , oily goodness. The smoke bellows in waves over the thick rich mouth feel. Finish : A pleasing spicy finish of sea salt and black pepper. Again sweetness almost like eating burnt cotton candy while walking along beach rocks This is where the barrel comes through with wood and spice Overall , Simply wonderful , A Classic expression.  Ardbeg 10 has this softness to it not found in many Islays. It also balances the smokiness perfectly against all the many aromes, not making it overpowering on the nose. I agree with ironlion27. This is the worst whisky I have ever tasted.  The pour looks like white grape juice...extremely pale SRM and very clear. A nice swirl give you slowly cascading, thin legs. Aroma is really out of sight and quite the treat for smokeheads out there. Peat and iodine are restrained in comparison to baked and smoked brisket. Rich potpourri florals and sweet grapefruit cut any savory meatiness or fattiness. No formaldehyde or over the top smoke attributes. Lots of bacon grease, lavender, rich alcohol heaviness and soft booziness. Taste is not so smoke heavy with mild peat and sharp iodine. Lots of mild and warming alcohol spice are complimented by lavender and bitter grapefruit, smoked meat, spicy sausage, chamomile. Very soft on the palate with a long stinging finish but no ""heat"" or excessive warming alcohol. Pretty much zero oak component- which is a godsend. Outstanding. Can't wait to try some special edition versions.  At a whisky tasting at my friend's home, I tasted the Bowmore Surf and Enigma. I couldn't stand the smokey taste of them. When I read the Bowmore reviews, I knew I had to learn to appreciate the Islay taste and I decided to buy a bottle of Ardbeg. After the first 3 drams, I was surprised by the explosion of taste and the balance of the Ardbeg.  Nose: Lots of smoke here. I took me a while to discover the hint of lemon coming through. Taste: The taste is the complete opposite of the nose; Strong citrus, salt, some sweet vanilla and little smoke. Finish: A nice, very long finish. The smoke returns here accompanied by anise. Ardbeg is a wee Islay distillery that has risen to near legendary status, thanks in no small part to claims like this one of Jim Murray’s: “Unquestionably, the greatest distillery to be found on Earth.” (No hyperbole there, I’m sure.) To many, their 10 year-old is a benchmark peated malt Scotch whisky; much like the Lagavulin 16 year-old, the Ardbeg TEN helps to define the genre of the peated, coastal malt. It is not chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. According to the label, this imparts “MAXIMUM FLAVOUR”—and we Connosrs well know that whisky never benefits from being bottled above this strength. The nose is smoked kippers, iodine, cracked pepper, anise, and citrus fruits—most notably lime. There are also hints of clove, orange peel, cocoa, apples, and the merest hint of sulfur. (As an aside, I poured this dram at a tasting some weeks ago. The restaurant staff working in the kitchen and other areas of the restaurant noted the odorous wall of peat that greeted them when they walked into the room. One server claimed he thought he had walked into a distillery.) The palate is damp smoke, vanilla, salt, and smoked kippers, with a touch of citrus, anise, and tar. Limes appear on the finish before giving way to chilis. The Ardbeg TEN is a lovely dram. Sophisticated, complex, and more than just a study in peat.  I tasted this one over the weekend. Not a fan of the peated whiskies, but this one I could get use to. Nose: This one can fill a room with the smell of a camp fire. Good strong smoke scent. Taste: Very rich and full flavor with smoke and peat. There is a hint of sea salt. I was expecting a taste of iodine, but to my surprise, very little. Finish: Long finish. The layers of flavor could almost last the whole night. the king of smoke. very smoky, peaty, iodine, medicinal. this is a very tasty scotch. hardwood smoke, peppercorn and anise. you must like smoky, peaty scotches to adore this one. Well this is my tuppence worth on the Ardbeg 10. this afternoon I had a nice session with my neighbor which involved a Chivas 12, an Ardbeg 10, and a 21 y.o Glenfiddich.  Powerful, slightly woody and lending a strong backing to peat on the nose. the body Packs a nice little punch with an altogether smooth, well rounded and significant tinge of salt and peat. Smokey on the uptake, yet not overly medicinal or ashy. An easy, warm, smoky and considerate finish with a lingering sense of contentment. Overall impression: This is a great drop with distinct Islay qualities, leaving you with a warm feeling and an overall sense of appreciation for the Ardbeg line in general. Doesn't break the bank and marries up well well with a Montecristo 4. A well chosen 10. An 89 from me. Founded in 1815 in the Islay region and currently owned by Glenmorangie. Two fingers with one cube of ice. Very full-bodied. Extremely peaty and almost pungent with a overall medicinal taste. Very spicy but tolerable. Must buy for peat lovers. I had a miniature of this L0 Ardbeg 10, compared to later batches it had a slight acidity (milk acidity) Like the Corryvreckan, this has a smoky sweet nose and the scotch envelopes the tongue on contact. Salt enters after the sweetness, and the finish is very fresh and vegetal. I like the Corryvreckan as well, but this has a slight edge for me and costs a lot less. This is a well-reviewed scotch, so I'm not pretending that I'll really add anything of consequence here other than recording my thoughts for my own benefit. I'm confused as to how to rate this scotch. It only does one thing -- peat -- which ought to count against it. But it does that one thing very, very well. If you want a glass of peat-smoke with some strong, raw malt (cut this with some water!), this is your scotch. So I've got no choice but to give this a nice middling six. After my first sip, I thought ""this is bad""... after two more sips, I was thinking ""this is the best whisky I ever tasted"". I like the taste of the peat. Ardbeg hardly needs any kind of intro, but just for completeness’ sake, I’ll just say this. Ardbeg is famous for it’s very peated malts and hails from Islay. They are considered by many whisky aficionados to be among the best whiskies in the world. This classic 10 Year Old is non chill filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. While I’m still admiring the strawlike color, the scent of peat already permeates the air. It’s dominant, but after a couple of whiffs you can also discover grassy notes and burnt rubber – even a little bit of overripe banana. Putting the Kleenex next to me for my first gulp was somewhat premature. Sure, it’s a peated dram, but it doesn’t burn. It’s very herbal and leaves you with a lingering warmth. That warmth remains during the intense and long spicy finish. Yes, this is classic Ardbeg and should be considered essential to every whiskylover’s cabinet. This is the WORST whiskey I have ever tasted...it made me commit one of the 2 deadly sins of the whiskey world...I poured out a glass of this stuff. The other deadly sin being of course adding more than 2 ice cubes ;) I had to double check across the interweb to make sure that I hadn't been scammed and had accidentally ingested a rotten bottle (if alcohol can rot?) By far the worst drink, much less whiskey, I have ever drank.  Aroma of Windex...taste of Windex...DISGUSTING! Nose powerful - peat, salt and iodine, the smell is very balanced and warm. Citrus, floral notes and vanilla sweetness.
Taste peaty, smoky, salty, slightly medicinal, spicy warmth with a tantalising hint of sweetness , complex, but in a good way, and extremely balanced.
Finish Warm, long, smoky and brillant! Comments A great dram.  Immediately peaty with a touch of smoke blooms into puckering and weaze. Reminder of Glenfiddich without the honey, drier, and peatier. Spiney on the tongue and a taste that rolls away before the feeling does. I tried some Islay whiskies when I first got into malts and I'm not embarrassed to admit I found them a little aggressive on the peat. Whilst Ardbeg wasn't one of them, I mention it because I recently decided to dip my toe back into the Islay waters. I bought this and a bottle of Laphroaig 10 year old (also reviewed) for starters.  The good news is my taste buds have grown up and are now more than ready! To my surprise flavours I may previously have written off as being too full-on revealed themselves in potent and yet somehow subtle layers of complexity. Ardbeg 10 has the expected hit of smokey peat but this is balanced by a lovely sweetness giving way to a salty finish. The overall combination of flavours is truly delicious, well balanced and rewarding.  I haven't been to Islay but I felt breathing in the wind coming off the sea would feel like this.This whisky has a sense of place.  I love it and I can't wait to delve deeper into the Ardbeg range. Nose - Big hit of peat, Medicinal (more so than bottlings of a few years ago), Iodine, Chlorine, Smoky Bacon, Frazzles (corn-based bacon flavoured snack), slightly sweet, Lemon-Drizzle Cake, Peppermint right on the death? Palate - Creamy, smoky, vanilla-laden, oranges, cloves, salty and tangy. Finish - Peaty to the last, but a great creamy seam of flavour runs through the finish. Salty home-made fudge. Water brings out even more peat on the nose, and a real coal-tar character that was hiding behind the barley without water. This is (astonishingly) even better than the 10yo of a year or two ago, when my understanding is that older and rarer casks were being used to make up the blend. Seems that Glenmorangie have really, really got it right with the new production.  Awesome. There's no other word for it. No other distillery in the world has anything anywhere near this impressive as their base expression. The nose is powerful - peat, salt, a little iodine and an underlying sweetness. I can leave it sitting on a coffee table more than a metre away, and within a minute, I get gentle wafts of the smell. Very balanced too, and warm. The taste takes a few seconds to gently and smoothly bloom into a deeply warm, peaty, smoky, salty, slightly medicinal, spicy warmth with a tantalising hint of sweetness - complex, but in a good way, and superbly balanced. Every sip tastes a little bit different, and all of them taste brilliant! The finish is long and warm - filled with salt, smoke and peat with a just enough spice to make sure that your lips tingle for some time after each sip. My first Islay malt was the Lagavulin, and if I were to make a recommendation, that's probably not the dram you should suggest to someone who was just getting into whisky and had only tried the Glenfiddich range up until that point. Suffice it to say, that Islay malts weren't my thing for a while. The Ardbeg 10 year old is the malt that changed all that. While the Lagavulins and Laphroig's have a little bit of a 'punch you in the face and take no prisoners' attitude towards flavour (and that is one of the many reasons I now love them), the Ardbeg is a little more urbane. It has all the elements that make Islay malts great (salt, iodine, smoke and peat), but keeps them within elegantly balanced limits. This isn't my favourite Ardbeg expression (that would be the Uigedail), but it is a genuinely fantastic drink, and the perfect introduction to Islay malts for those who are ready. At least, it was for me. It is just like biting into a piece of salty burnt drift wood. Nose: Peat, leather, caramelized plums, brine and a hint of sweet bourbon (think Basil Hayden’s more than Maker’s Mark) Palate:Lightly peated compared to some other Islays, this whiskey lets the malted barley shine through. As with other peated whiskies, there are definite notes of licorice and iodine. Finish:Despite it’s astringent mouth feel, the taste of peat and iodine stick around long after you swallow this one. A long finish is one of the trademarks of Islay malts, but this was surprising. Comments:This whisky provides a good introduction to peated single malts. It is not overly peated and offers some of the cereal notes and sweetness you get from lightly or unpeated whiskies. I expected a little bit more complexity from an unfiltered whisky though. The astringent quality and pale color are both odd for Islay whiskies. Whiskies from the Islay region tend toward a darker color and more oily mouth feel. This one is good for someone just getting into Islay malts, but I would recommend Laphroaig, Lagavulin, or Talisker (technically from Skye, not Islay, but similar taste profile) over this one."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,46,Ardbeg 10 Year Old 75clOB,"The reviewed bottle, marked L10 152, has been open for over 2 years. It is 70% full. The flavours have changed relatively little over that time.  Nose: relatively strong intensity peat and smoke, medium and high pitched barley malt, muted honey, and some brine. Delicious. Taste: excellent translation onto the palate; the flavours are pointed and attention-getting. Sweetness is in abundance, more so than in the nose. This bottle has gotten a bit sweeter with time open.  Finish: long and strong continuation of flavours from the palate. They stay the same over a good span of time. Balance: if you like the ""sweet peat/smoke and brine"" style of malts, then you will probably like Ardbeg Ten. You don't get the wine finishes with this, but then again, most peat-lovers can do without wine finishes for their malts. Within the genre of strongly flavoured highly peated smokey malt whiskies, Ardbeg Ten is a solid performer and an excellent value for money. "
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,40,Ardbeg 10 Year Old bottled 1980s Clear Glass BottleOB,I found this Whisky more refined than the Laphroaig 10 year and sweet with less of the smokey peat and Iodine taste. A plus or a negative based on what your trying to get out of the whisky taste wise.  From first taste its a smooth sweetness that glides over the tongue into a peat and smoked wood flavour. It has a pleasant hidden kick which gets you right at the end.  impressive and a smart Islay addition to your cabinet. 
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,46,Ardbeg 10 Year Old bottled 2000sOB,"My love affair with peated whisky began with my first introduction to peat. I wasn't on the fence, I was absorbed. Ardbeg - it's all your fault.  I just want to nose this all night. This is crisp and clean.  Nose: Phenolic peat, dark chocolate, lemon, vanilla, malt, salt, limestone  Taste: Brine, lemon, lime, sardines, green pears  Finish: Peat, campfire smoke, tar, the finish is long and fades gently  This 46% is smoother than many a 40%. I really love this whisky and hope that the distiller can maintain the quality. Batch: L12 047 07:37 6ML p.s. the title, this whisky fondly reminds me of my childhood at my grandparents house. Immigrants from the UK who had an old gas heater for the cold winters. The smell just takes me back."
Ardbeg,Port Ellen,Islay,1815,LVMH,40,Ardbeg 17 Year OldOB,"When it comes to Ardbeg I expect a strong and robust offering. However when it came to tasting the much famed Ardbeg 17, the experience was, well, not exactly matching my expectations.  Nose: Delicate is not a word I have used to describe Ardbegs in the past but this is exactly the first thing that comes to your mind when your nose is greeted with all the fruity notes. I'd say a bit of tangerines, apricots and lime. The longer you left the more it seemed like dehydrated fruit pieces of pineapple. Now there are traces of the peat in there but they are all hidden well below the top notes.. and one had to really dig them out. There's also some eucalyptus oil that you can find. Did get some damp mud notes in there as well. Palate: The first sip has an usually sweet start that quickly disappears and gets replaced with a lot of sooty notes. The sweet is more on the sugar syrupy side. You do find some mild peppery spiciness initially which does get a lot more pronounced by the second sip. For me the palate was this expression's weakest part with not much to offer. Finish: This one has a fairly nice finish with liquorice, pepper, some mild fruit notes and finally a lot of spearmint. By the time you have the second sip the spearmint flavors tend to linger much long giving it a nice ending.  All in all this is one Ardbeg that you're bound to have the house divided on in terms of their opinions. You'd either really like it for its uniqueness or you won't due to your liking for a certain delivery that you've come to expect from this distillery.  They say love is illogical and fascination need not have a reason. I say they. I actually mean me. Early on in my journey as a malt nerd I decided that I would devote my irrational emotions to a little known distillery by the name of Ardbeg. It started with the 10. Then the Uigi. The Corry was followed by the Alligator and I began getting hooked. Desire trumped logic and I flippantly decided that I would make it my life's mission to acquire as many Ardbeg expressions as I humanly (read financially) could.  And, thus, for no reason other than personal satisfaction began my journey towards financial ruin. Of them all there was one which got my attention above all the rest. It was the 17 year old. I don't know why. I proffer no explanation other than there was something mysteriously beautiful about it.  Given that it was getting increasingly rare on the ground I had a hard time finding one at a good price but somehow managed. Not wanting to crack my full 70cl open for a few nips I managed to procure a couple of minis for a tasting.  And so after lusting behind this malt for over four years I finally sat down and fulfilled my silly little love dream.  Nose: Very mild peat. When I say mild I mean it's really mild. Delicate soot. Tangerines. Cured meats. Sweet fish oil (if there is such a thing). Apricots. Dehydrated berries. Pineapple. Iodine and eucalyptus. It gets sweeter over time with a cherry cola quality. It is quite possibly one of the mildest Ardbegs on the nose ever. After a while you could be forgiven for thinking it might actually be a Speysider. There's none of the real Ardbeg aromas. It's not bad but it seems like everything is bit subdued. Palate: Mild. Cardboard. Sweet lemon. Fruits with a wisp of smoke. Very faint peppers. Touch of mint. The palate is once again on the softer side. Everything is held back a touch. Finish: Disappears at first but then comes back well. Oily with hints of oak and fruit spearmint. Jim Murray had a hand in crafting this expression and it was the first one to emerge from the distillery when it re-opened under Glenmorangie's leadership. I think the intention was to re-introduce the distillery to a much much wider audience with flavors deemed palatable to the novice drinker. I wish I had drunk this many years ago when it first came out. I would have liked it much better then. Today, while I still think this is a fine dram, I missed the robustness of the Ardbeg flavors that I am so used to. But love is blind and I am happy that I was able to cross this one off the top of my list. If there is one single malt that Jim Murray had a hand in creating it was the Ardbeg 17 year old. He claims it almost every time you care to listen. In 2004 I stopped in a small liquor store in Green Hills near Nashville. They had four bottles of 50mL minitures of Ardbeg 17yo . . . and I bought them all. I have tasted them over the years. This was my third mini bottle, and on this night I tasted against the Airigh Nam Beist and the 1977 Ardbeg. Here are my thoughts on the 17yo.  Nose: Nice, clean ripe fruits linger behind a very delicate bed of peat. It is very sharp and alcoholic attack for only 43%. More of a lingering fire with only bits of peat and smoke. The fruits certainly remind me of Glenmorangie with all the citrus orange and lemon. There are hints of apple and pear also, but then comes the white pepper. There is certainly a hint of both the Speysiders (Glen-something) and the highlanders (Glenmorangie, Oban). This is certainly an “all-things-for-all-people-type-of-malt.” Really, it is the lightest nose of the night. And I am saddened for all the great casks (peated and unpeated) that were used to make this . . . at a mere 43%. It works, but it could have been so much better . . . Water only adds to the “all-things” ambiguity. Now there are only hints of hints of hints . . . I can see Jim Murray’s values in this whisky.  Taste: Very interesting dry and only semi-sweet arrival of peat, seaweed, and oak. There is a slight soapiness if you concentrate too hard. Still, there is tons of sharp citrus attacking the tongue. With water you get a bit of that old 70’s Ardbeg diesel oil and the citrus takes a bit of a back seat. Strangely, I like this better with water.  Finish: Very salty and typical Ardbeg, but with only a whisper of peat and smoke. It is like the shadow of a typical Ardbeg 10yo finish. No wave of peat; just the salty remnants of where the ocean once was. The wave aside, it is still a medium to medium short finish - and boy does it stay with you . . . all warming like with the salt attacking your mouth. With water more of that pine note I am picking up on in the other two Ardbegs tonight – and it is more warming. Complexity, Balance: I will say that the nose is well balanced to the extreme. It is like they vatted Ardbeg with about 5 other single malts in a very perfect way. You get the apple from Glenfiddich, the grass and lemon from Glenlivet, the orange zest from Glenmorangie, and the spice and wood from Oban along with the peat from Ardbeg. So balance is off the chart. Complexity . . . it is up there. Not as complex as the other Ardbegs tonight, but certainly up there in the single malt category. Aesthetic experience: I don’t love the 43%, but I do like the bottle, label, color (lightest of the night), and age. My thought is that Ardbeg should do a 10yo, 16yo, and 21yo in the coming years . . . but I doubt they will. Seventeen just seems on the verge . . . at sixteen you are in Lagavulin land. At eighteen you are up with almost every other distillery. 17yo . . . it just seems off on its own planet . . . much like this dram.  Conclusion: A few months later after I picked up these miniatures (and tired one) I saw a shelf of Ardbeg 17yo (keep in mind this is 2004). I knew that Ardbeg 17yo was on the outs and that Uigeadail was the new thing. I remember thinking, “I should buy a case of these and leave them in my parents basement.” And hindsight has proved my point. A bottle of this sells for 4x’s what I would have paid that day. BUT . . . I would only have bought it for the resale – which I don’t believe in. This was fun to taste, but I don’t love it. I hear this has some unpeated Ardbeg in it. I hope that if Ardbeg every offers a 17 year old again that it will be fully peated Ardbeg at 46% (or more). This style is just too “Jim Murray-ish-balanced” for me. If you like that style you will love it! Keywords : fruity, earthy, peaty, woody, bitter, water Balance : Very Good Finish : Medium-Long, intense"
